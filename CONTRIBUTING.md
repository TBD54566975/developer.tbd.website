#### Contributing Content

It's important for the integrity of our documentation to remain in tact while adding content to our docs site. We do this by making sure that most of the code snippets we display are also testable from an execution standpoint. If you plan on editing or adding code snippets to our docs, please follow the guideline below:

#### Adding Code Snippets

We have a folder at `./site/code-snippets`. It reflects the same structure that we have for `./site/docs`. If you'd like to add or edit code snippets in `./site/docs/web5/build/decentralized-web-nodes/query-from-dwn.mdx`, please make sure that the code snippets location mirrors that path. For example: `./site/code-snippets/web5/build/decentralized-web-nodes/query-from-dwn.js`

You can now edit the `query-from-dwn.js` file with code snippets that you want to display in the docs.

#### Function convention

Here is what an ideal function should look like in the `query-from-dwn.js`:

```js
export async function queryRecordWithParentId(web5) {
  const response = await web5.dwn.records.query({
    message: {
      filter: {
        parentId: "bafyreianzpmhbgcgam5mys722vnsiuwn7y4ek6kjeyjptttquasw4hge2m",
      },
    },
  });

  return response;
}
```

Requirements:

- Must export function
- Must pass web5 object (web5 gets instatiated when the tests run)

**Note**

- Everything written within the body of the function will be extracted and added to a `code-snippets-map.json` file. These are not executable, they are only to be used for content.
- `return` statements are excluded from being shown, however, we still need them for testing purposes
- For situations where it doesn't make sense to return anything, we will exclude them from being tested

#### Displaying Code Snippets in MDX

We have a `<CodeSnippets />` component for displaying the code within the JSON map. This is how you use it:

<CodeSnippet functionName="CODE_SNIPPET_FUNCTION_NAME" />

**Example**

```jsx
import CodeSnippet from "@site/src/components/CodeSnippet";

<CodeSnippet functionName="queryProtocolsForMusic" />;
```

This will display the following:

```js
const { protocols } = await web5.dwn.protocols.query({
  message: {
    filter: {
      protocol: "https://music.org/protocol",
    },
  },
});
```

This is the original function within the file for that page for reference:

```js
export async function queryProtocolsForMusic(web5) {
  const { protocols } = await web5.dwn.protocols.query({
    message: {
      filter: {
        protocol: "https://music.org/protocol",
      },
    },
  });

  return protocols;
}
```

#### Testing the code snippets

We use the same folder convention that we do for the `/code-snippets` directory. It should mirror how the docs are currently laid out.

We will have a `__tests__` directory per project within the monorepo, to it should look like this:

`./site/**tests**/web5/build/decentralized-web-nodes/query-from.dwn.test.js`

\*\*Note the `.test.` naming convention. This is how Vite will know to run these tests.

Import the code snippets from the original file to run tests against them. Here's an example:

```js
import { test, beforeAll, expect } from "vitest";
import {
  queryProtocolsWithFilterDescending,
  queryRecordsWithFilterAscending,
  queryProtocolsForMusic,
  queryRecordsFromDID,
  queryRecordWithParentId,
} from "../../../../code-snippets/web5/build/decentralized-web-nodes/query-from-dwn";
import { Web5 } from "@web5/api/browser";

let web5;
let did;

// connect to web5 beforeAll tests and assign it to web5 variable. This is how we pass the web5 instance to the code snippets:
beforeAll(async () => {
  const result = await Web5.connect();
  web5 = result.web5;
  did = result.did;
});

test("queryProtocolsForMusic returns an array of protocols", async () => {
  const protocols = await queryProtocolsForMusic(web5);
  expect(Array.isArray(protocols)).toBe(true);
});
```

#### Running tests

You can use the following scripts to run the tests:

`pnpm test` to run tests just once
`pnpm test:watch` to run tests in dev mode
