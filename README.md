# TBD Developer Site

This is a monorepo powered by [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) that includes a documentation site, tutorials and examples. This repository allows you to conveniently manage multiple projects within a single repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.16.0 or later)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (version 7.29.1 or later)

## Installation

To install `pnpm` globally on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:

```shell
npm install -g pnpm
```

3. Wait for the installation process to complete.

> Note: If you already have `pnpm` installed globally, you can skip this step.

## Getting Started

To get started with the monorepo and run the available scripts, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/TBD54566975/developer.tbd.website.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd developer.tbd.website
```

3. Install project dependencies using `pnpm`:

```shell
pnpm install
```

4. Once the installation is complete, you are ready to run the available scripts.

## Scripts

The following scripts are available for running specific tasks within the monorepo:

- `pnpm start`: Runs the docs site.
- `pnpm start:tutorial-todo-starter`: Starts the local server for the todo app tutorial.
- `pnpm start:tutorial-todo-completed`: Starts the local server for the completed todo app.
- `pnpm start:widget`: Runs the completed web5 widget
- `pnpm clear`: Runs docusaurus clear

## Running commands

If for whatever reason, you'd like to run pnpm commands on specific packages only, use the `--filter` flag and refer to the package name of the project.

Filter docs: https://pnpm.io/filtering

For example, if you wanted to add a library to the docs site itself:

`pnpm --filter docs add some-library`

If you look at the package.json under the path: `/site/package.json`, you'll see the "name" attribute says "docs", which is what we're using to target.
