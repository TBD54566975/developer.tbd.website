At TBD, we believe in a decentralized future that returns ownership and control 
over your finances, data, and identity. Decentralized Identity is critical to 
our mission. It’s what puts people in control of their own data. It is the most 
private, secure, and user-centric way to facilitate information exchange and 
verification online.

The [Decentralized Identity Foundation](http://identity.foundation/) 
(DIF) is a cooperative community that 
shares and advances our vision. We’re honored to work alongside members like 
[Spruce](https://spruceid.com/), [Transmute](https://transmute.industries/), 
and others on open standards which drive this work forward.
Today we're announcing that we’ve achieved another milestone on that journey.

TBD and Spruce are the first implementers to demonstrate full interoperability 
for the JSON Web Signature Test Suite. These tests are a major step towards 
vendor interoperability. Interop is what allows standard technologies to play 
nicely with one another, regardless of the backing vendor implementation.

TBD and Spruce now support all 
[five JWS algorithms](https://w3id.org/security/suites/jws-2020#jose-conformance) 
for [JSON Web Signature 2020](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/) 
(Data Integrity Proofs) using 
[JSON Web Tokens](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) (JWTs) 
for [W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) (VCs) 
and [W3C Verifiable Presentations](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations-0) 
(VPs).

We can only realize the full potential of Decentralized Identity if we 
have networks of Issuers and Verifiers that can produce and consume one 
another’s data. The real power of Decentralized Identity is the controlled 
sharing of information directly between individuals and other entities, 
which makes interoperability a necessity.

More details about the Conformance Test Suite that was developed by members 
of DIF and our interoperability test reports can be found here:

* [TBD’s test results of JWS Test Suite](https://identity.foundation/JWS-Test-Suite/#tbd)
* [Spruce’s test results of JWS Test Suite](https://identity.foundation/JWS-Test-Suite/#spruce)

At TBD, we support open standards wherever appropriate, and all of our projects are open source. We know our efforts will only be successful if we work in public with the community. We are grateful to work with folks like Spruce and Transmute in the W3C and DIF. By collaborating on common goals in accordance with our ethos, as this achievement exemplifies, we can accelerate the adoption of Decentralized Identity.
