As stewards of an open source ecosystem, we welcome 
innovation from the community. To encourage new ideas 
from folks around the world, today we launch the TBD 
Open Source Incubation Program.

<!--truncate-->

TBD Incubation projects are managed by community 
contributors. They advance the decentralized web and 
accelerate development and adoption of the Web5 
platform. Like all projects in the TBD ecosystem, 
they follow our [Code of Conduct](/open-source/code-of-conduct) 
and Governance model, 
fostering an inclusive community. Incubation projects 
benefit from TBD’s open source programs including 
[GitHub](https://github.com/TBD54566975), 
[TBD Forums](https://forums.tbd.website), 
and our [Discord](https://discord.gg/tbd) server.

When projects reach maturity, they may apply to be 
promoted out of Incubation into a central project.

We’ll soon be announcing our first Incubation project! 
More on that to come from the project founders!

Got ideas you’d like to build with us? Propose an 
idea in our 
[Governance Forums](https://forums.tbd.website/c/tbd-governance/12),
and include:

* Statement of value to the TBD ecosystem (Web5, tbDEX, etc)
* Link to repo and code
* Description or graphic on user flow
* Description or graphic on info flow between services
