Block recently partnered with the [Human Rights Foundation](https://hrf.org/) to present **Currency of Freedom**, a series of fireside chats with humanitarians, activists, and leaders who shared their stories of relying on bitcoin for critical financial access.

Many people, especially those who do not live under authoritarian rule, struggle to see the potential of bitcoin beyond an investment opportunity. But for those who live under oppressive regimes, bitcoin has quite literally been a currency of freedom.

Mike Brock, Head of TBD, sat down with Human Rights Foundation Chairman, Garry Kasparov, to discuss bitcoin as a tool to help protect and expand democracy and freedom around the world.

Angie Jones, TBD's Head of Developer Relations, spoke with human rights activist Meron Estefanos, who shared her story of using bitcoin to send money to Eritrean refugees in East Africa.
