We are excited to announce the latest upgrade of the SSI-Service, which is now
available [here](https://ssi.benri.io). This upgrade introduces a new playground feature that
allows users to interact more dynamically with their credentials, keys, and
Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).

<!--truncate-->

The upgraded [SSI-Service](https://ssi.benri.io) by TBD hosted @ Benri now provides a more interactive
playground feature that allows users to explore the capabilities of SSI more
effectively. This playground feature is accessible here and provides users with
a more dynamic and engaging console for managing their identity information.

The new playground feature enables users to interact with their credentials,
keys, and DIDs more easily and intuitively. Users can create, update, and revoke
their DIDs, and manage their DID documents with ease. They can also create and
manage Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and use them to apply for credentials,
exchange credentials, and manage credential revocations and suspensions.

In addition, the playground feature includes a more interactive console for API
interaction, allowing users to test and explore the RESTful API for managing the
SSI service in real-time. The console also provides Swagger docs, which offer
detailed documentation for the SSI-Service's APIs, making it easier for users to
understand how to interact with the platform.

Overall, the new playground feature makes it easier and more engaging for users
to explore the power of SSI and take control of their digital identities. The
upgraded SSI-Service provides a secure and decentralized platform for identity
management, and the new playground feature makes it even more accessible and
user-friendly.

In conclusion, the upgraded SSI-Service now provides a more interactive
playground feature that allows users to explore the capabilities of SSI more
effectively. With improved DID management, more interactive console for managing
credentials, keys, and DIDs, and a more user-friendly API interaction, the
upgraded SSI-Service offers a more engaging and dynamic experience for users. If
you're interested in exploring the power of self-sovereign identity, visit

Stay tuned for more updates as they get rolled along.
