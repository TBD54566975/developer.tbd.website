<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm" 
  target="_blank">Node Package Manager - NPM</a></p>
<p>Ensure you have the Node Package Manager, <code>npm</code>, installed and on your system's <code>$PATH</code>.</p>
:::

<h2>Installation</h2>

Commands below will be done in your terminal.

<h4>1. Create Directory:</h4>
<p>This will be the home of your new Web5 app.</p>
<pre>mkdir web5-app</pre>
<pre>cd web5-app</pre>

<h4>2. Install Web5:</h4>

<p>We'll be using the NPM package manager. Run <code>npm</code> to install Web5:</p>

<pre>npm install @tbd54566975/web5@0.4.0</pre>

:::info
After npm resolves the dependency you may see a few warnings which you can ignore for now. 
:::

This will add Web5 as a dependency of the project, which you should now see in <code>package.json</code>. It will also resovle its transitive dependencies in a file called <code>package-lock.json</code> and place those dependencies in a folder called <code>node_modules</code>.

To verify everything is working, open <code>package.json</code> or run in Mac/Linux systems:
<pre>cat package.json</pre>

This should look like:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@tbd54566975/web5": "^0.4.0"
  }
}
```

<h4>3. Import Dependencies:</h4>

Copy to come about why we need to import dependencies and why we're creating a filename called index.js.

<pre>mkdir src</pre>

<pre>cd src</pre>

<pre>touch index.js</pre>

Open `web5-app/index.js` in your editor and paste at the top:
```js
import { Web5 } from '@tbd54566975/web5'
```

## WE MAY REMOVE THIS...

:::info
Now you'll need to add `module` as a type in your `package.json` like so:

```js
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@tbd54566975/web5": "^0.4.0"
  },
  "type": "module"
}
```
:::
Alrighty, congrats! You've completed your installation and are ready to start building and working with the main functionality of the app!
