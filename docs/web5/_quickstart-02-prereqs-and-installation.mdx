<p>Ensure you have the Node Package Manager, <code>npm</code>, installed and on your system's <code>$PATH</code>.</p>

# Installation
### 1. Create Directory
<p>This will be the home of your new Web5 app.</p>

In terminal:

```bash
mkdir web5-app
```

```bash
cd web5-app
```

### 2. Install Web5

<p>We'll be using the NPM package manager to install Web5:</p>

```bash
npm install @tbd54566975/web5@0.6.0
```

:::note
After npm resolves the dependency you may see a few warnings which you can ignore for now.
:::

This adds Web5 as a dependency of the project, which you will see in `package.json`. It also resolves its transitive dependencies in the `package-lock.json` file and places those dependencies in the `node_modules` directory.

Open `package.json` and add `module` as a type:

```js
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@tbd54566975/web5": "^0.6.0"
  },
  "type": "module"
}
```

### 3. Import Web5

Let's create a `src` directory and `index.js` file to write our application:

```bash
mkdir src
```

```bash
cd src
```

```bash
touch index.js
```

Open `index.js` in your editor and add this line at the top of the file to import Web5:
```js
import { Web5 } from '@tbd54566975/web5';
```

Now, we have the Web5 SDK installed and are ready to start building!
