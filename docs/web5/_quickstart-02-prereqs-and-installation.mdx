## Installation

:::info
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm" 
    target="_blank">Node Package Manager</a>, <code>npm</code>, installed and on your system's <code>$PATH</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Node version 18 and above</p>
  </li>
</ul>
:::

### 1. Create a directory
<p>This will be the home of your new Web5 app. In your CLI: </p> 

```bash
mkdir web5-app
cd web5-app
```

### 2. Install Web5

<p>Use NPM to install Web5:</p>

```bash
npm install @tbd54566975/web5@0.7.9
```

:::note
After `npm` resolves the dependency, you may see a few warnings. You can ignore these for now.
:::

This will create a `package.json` in the root of your project. Open `package.json` and add `module` as a type:

```js
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@tbd54566975/web5": "0.7.9"
  },
  "type": "module"
}
```

### 3. Import Web5

Let's create an `index.js` file to write our application:

```bash
touch index.js
```

Open `index.js` in your editor and add this line at the top of the file to import Web5:
```js
import { Web5 } from '@tbd54566975/web5';
```

Now we have the Web5 SDK installed and are ready to start building!
