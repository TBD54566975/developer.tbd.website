<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

  target="_blank">Node Package Manager - NPM</a></p>
<p>Ensure you have the Node Package Manager, <code>npm</code>, installed and on your system's <code>$PATH</code>.</p>
:::

# Installation
### 1. Create Directory:
<p>This will be the home of your new Web5 app.</p>

In terminal:
<pre>mkdir web5-app</pre>

<pre>cd web5-app</pre>

### 2. Install Web5:

<p>We'll be using the NPM package manager. Run <code>npm</code> to install Web5:</p>

<pre>npm install @tbd54566975/web5@0.4.0</pre>

*After npm resolves the dependency you may see a few warnings which you can ignore for now.*

This will add Web5 as a dependency of the project, which you will see in <code>package.json</code>. It will also resolve its transitive dependencies in a file called <code>package-lock.json</code> and place those dependencies in a folder called <code>node_modules</code>.

Open `package.json` and add `module` as a type:
```js
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@tbd54566975/web5": "^0.4.0"
  },
  "type": "module"
}
```

### 3. Import Dependencies:
<pre>mkdir src</pre>

<pre>cd src</pre>

<pre>touch index.js</pre>

Open `web5-app/index.js` in your editor and paste this at the top:
```js
import { Web5 } from '@tbd54566975/web5';
```

Congrats! You've completed your installation and are ready to start building and working with the main functionality of the SDK.
