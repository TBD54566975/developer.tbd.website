## Create Web5 App instance:

There’s only one class needed for all operations, it creates an isolated API object for doing all things Web5.

Open your <code>index.js</code> file and add this below your Web5 import:

<pre>const web5 = new Web5()</pre>

## *Objects within Web5:*
Web5 is split into three main top-level objects:
- web5.dwn
- web5.did
- web5.vc

We're going to focus on `web5.did` and `web5.dwn` namespace in this quickstart.

## 1. Create DID, `web5.did`:

:::info
A [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/),
is an W3C specification for an address representing who you are on the decentralized web. You 
can [learn more about them here](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers) as 
a core concept behind Web5.
:::

In the world of Web5 a user’s unique identifier, like an email address, is called a DID. This is a decentralized app so we need an identifier that isn’t tied to a centralized authority. It can be used to identify and associate a user’s data across any platform.

Let’s create a DID using the Web5 API with the <code>ion</code> method name. Right below your new Web5 instance add:
<pre>let did = await web5.did.create('ion');</pre>

*We’re using ION here as the method name, learn more about other method names [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods).*

## Test this out:

### Option 1. In `index.js`:
Add `console.log(did.id)` and in terminal run `node src/index.js`

Output should look like: `did:ion:EiBSuKWKAC0zpoM3KlhoyZxCHaMN5TBbcr...`
