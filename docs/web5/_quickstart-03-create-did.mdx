## 1. Instantiate Web5

The `Web5` class is an isolated API object for doing all things Web5 and the connect() function creates an instance of Web5.

In Web5 apps, a user’s unique identifier - like an email address - is called a [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers).
We are building a decentralized app, so your users are using identifiers that aren't tied to a centralized authority.

In `index.js` below the import statement, create a new instance of `Web5`:
```js
const { web5, did: aliceDid } = await Web5.connect();
```

This Web5 instance is what you'll use to access the other objects of Web5 such as `did` and `dwn`. Within the connect function we’re using `ion` as the DID method. Learn more about ION and other [DID methods](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers#methods).

:::info
Web5 is split into three main top-level objects:
- web5.did
- web5.dwn
- web5.vc

  <p>

  Wanna see the DID you just created? In <code>index.js</code>, add the following line and save your file:
  ```js
  console.log(aliceDid);
  ```

  Then from your CLI, run:
  ```bash
  node src/index.js
  ```

  You'll see the newly created DID.
