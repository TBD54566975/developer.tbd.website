# Start Building

## 1. Create Web5 App Instance

The `Web5` class is an isolated API object for doing all things Web5.

In `index.js` below the import statement, create a new instance of `Web5`:

```js
const web5 = new Web5();
```

:::info
Web5 is split into three main top-level objects:
- web5.did
- web5.dwn
- web5.vc

We're going to focus on `web5.did` and `web5.dwn` in this Quickstart.
:::

## 2. Create DID

:::info
In Web5 apps, a user’s unique identifier - like an email address - is called a [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers). 
We are building a decentralized app, so your users are using identifiers that aren't tied to a centralized authority. Their DIDs are used to identify and associate the user’s data across any decentralized platform.
:::

Assuming a brand new user who does not yet have a DID, let’s create their DID using the Web5 API. Below the Web5 instantiation, add:
```js
let did = await web5.did.create('ion');
```

:::info
We’re using `ion` as the DID method. Learn more about ION and other [DID methods](http://localhost:3000/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers#methods).

  <summary>Test your code</summary>
  <p>
  Wanna see the created DID?

  In <code>index.js</code>, add the following line and save your file:
  ```js
  console.log(did.id);
  ```

  Then from the terminal, run:
  ```bash
  node src/index.js
  ```

  You'll see the newly created DID.
