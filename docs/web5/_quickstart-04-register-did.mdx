## 2. Register DID, `web5.did.register`:

You need to register your DID in order for a user to give other apps (or users) a way to find them, message them, and send them data provided they have permission.

Paste in `index.js`:
```js
await web5.did.register({
    connected: true,
    did: did.id,
    endpoint: 'app://dwn',
    keys: did.keys[0].keypair,
});

const data = 'Hello Web5';

console.log('write data', data);
```

Run `index.js` in terminal:
<pre>node src/index.js</pre>

Output should look like this:
<pre>write data Hello Web5</pre>

### Play around without opening terminal, click `Run!` to register your DID from the sandbox above, `web5.did.register`:
