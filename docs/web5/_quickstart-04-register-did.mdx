## 2. Store DID Keys, `web5.did.manager`:

When you instantiate Web5, the SDK internally creates a Decentralized Web Node (explained in next step) to act as a personal data store to store your DID keys.

In order to store your DID, save and encrypt your keys with the Web5 SDK with `web5.did.manager`.

Paste in `index.js`:
```js
await web5.did.manager.set({
    connected: true,
    did: did.id,
    endpoint: 'app://dwn',
    keys: did.keys[0].keypair,
});

const data = 'Hello Web5';

console.log('write data', data);
```

Run `index.js` in terminal:
<pre>node src/index.js</pre>

Output should look like this:
<pre>write data Hello Web5</pre>

### Play around without opening terminal, click `Run!` to  your DID from the sandbox above, `web5.did.manager`:
