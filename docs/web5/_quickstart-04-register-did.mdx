## 3. Associate DID with Storage

When you instantiate Web5, the SDK internally creates a [Decentralized Web Node(DWN)](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes) to act as a personal data store to hold your user's content.

To store the user's DID as well as save and encrypt their keys, add the following to `index.js`:

```js
await web5.did.manager.set(did.id, {
    connected: true,
    endpoint: 'app://dwn', //this points to the user's local DWN
    keys: {
        ['#dwn']: {
          keyPair: did.keys.find(key => key.id === 'dwn').keyPair,
        },
    },
});
```

:::note
In production apps, before doing this step, you'd check to make sure the user doesn't already have an existing DWN.
