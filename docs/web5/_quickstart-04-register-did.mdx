## 2. Store DID Keys, `web5.did.manager`:

When you instantiate Web5, the SDK internally creates a Decentralized Web Node (explained in next step) to act as a personal data store to hold your DID keys.

Store your DID as well as save and encrypt your keys with `web5.did.manager`. Paste in `index.js`:

```js
await web5.did.manager.set({
    connected: true,
    did: did.id,
    endpoint: 'app://dwn',
    keys: did.keys[0].keypair,
});

const data = 'Hello Web5';
```

:::note
To confirm your keys were set add `console.log('write data', data);` to `index.js` and in terminal run `node src/index.js`.

Output should say: `write data Hello Web5`.
