## 2. Store DID Keys, `web5.did.manager`:

When you instantiate Web5, the SDK internally creates a Decentralized Web Node (explained in next step) to act as a personal data store to hold your DID keys.

Store your DID as well as save and encrypt your keys with `web5.did.manager`. Add this to `index.js`:

```js
await web5.did.manager.set(did.id, {
    connected: true,
    endpoint: 'app://dwn',
    keys: {
        ['#dwn']: {
          keyPair: did.keys.find(key => key.id === 'dwn').keyPair,
        },
    },
});

const data = 'Hello Web5';
```

## Test this out:

### Option 1. In `index.js`:
Add `console.log('write data', data);`

Output should say: `write data Hello Web5`
