### 4. Write DWN Records

Now youâ€™re able to write records in the user's [Decentralized Web Node(DWN)](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes). 

A DWN is a personal data store - a platform for messages, pictures, videos, medical records, and just about any content a user may want to store.

  <p>
Your app should not store users' data in your centralized database. Instead, their data should be stored in their DWN. This is how the user retains ownership over their content. Through permissions, users can decide which apps can read, write, and delete content from their DWN.

The DWN exists in local storage under the name `dwn-info`. The DWN persists across browser sessions and can be synched across a user's devices. 

A user can host their DWN in mulitple locations. The Web5 SDK is both browser and Node.js compliant, meaning you can use the same APIs on both client side and serverside.

Add the following to `index.js`:
```js
const {record} = await web5.dwn.records.create(did.id, {
    author: did.id,
    data: "Hello Web5",
    message: {
        dataFormat: 'text/plain',
    },
});
```

  <p>
  Let's see what was just written to the DWN.

  In <code>index.js</code>, add the following line and save your file:
  ```js
  console.log('write result', record);
  ```

  Then from the terminal, run:
  ```bash
  node src/index.js
  ```

  You'll see the record that was written to the user's DWN. It will resemble:
  ```js
    write result _Record {}
  ```
  </p>

Enter "Hello Web5" in the input field and click "Run" to write a record to the sandbox DWN.
