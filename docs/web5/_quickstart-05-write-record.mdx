## 3. Storage, `web5.dwn.records`:

Now you’re able to write / store your app's data in what we call a Decentralized Web Node (DWN). A DWN is a personal data store - a platform for messages, pictures, videos, medical records, and just about any content a user may want to store.

Your app will no longer store users data in a centralized database like you're used to - it will be stored in their DWN. This is how the user retains ownership over their content. Through permissions, users can decide which apps can read, write, and delete content from their DWN.

*A user can host their DWN in mulitple locations. The Web5 JS library is both browser and Node.js compliant, meaning you can use the same APIs on both client side and serverside. The `dataFormat` value isn’t limited to `image/png`; it can be any `MIME` type.*

Add this to `index.js`:
```js
const writeResult = await web5.dwn.records.write(did.id, {
    author: did.id,
    data,
    message: {
        dataFormat: 'text/plain',
    },
});
```

## Test this out:
### Option 1. In `index.js`:
Add `console.log('write result', writeResult);`

Output should look like:
```code
write result {
  status: { code: 202, detail: 'Accepted' },
  entries: undefined,
  data: undefined,
  message: {
    recordId: 'bafyreicc65viceyqtl7sjdxbbxpuvs2nlagerzcblje2lvfhzqbmg4pqhm',
    descriptor: {
      interface: 'Records',
      method: 'Write',
      dataCid: 'bafkreibr4hojx6b7ukyqkmlw3em4f3ssnlcgwe33wt4uijofkswxpqysje',
      dataSize: 10,
      dateCreated: '2023-04-25T18:52:45.550765Z',
      dateModified: '2023-04-25T18:52:45.550765Z',
      dataFormat: 'text/plain'
    }
  },
  record: _Record {}
}
```
### Option 2. Upload image and click `Run!`:

*TO COME: I think we should be adding in info about where this DWN storage is...Does it persist? How can I see it?*
