## 4. Querying and Reading: 

### `web5.dwn.records.query`:
Querying a DWN allows you to search records depending on the filter params you pass to it. In the code snippet below, we're querying a DWN for messages that have a MIME type of text/plain. Note that you don't have to query based on MIME type, there are many different attributes you can use to query, such as protocol, schema, contextId, etc.

Add this to `index.js`:
```js
const queryResult = await web5.dwn.records.query(did.id, {
        author: did.id,
        message: {
            filter: {
              dataFormat: 'text/plain',
        },
    },
});
```
:::note
To see what this query will return add `console.log('query result', queryResult);` to `index.js` and in terminal run `node src/index.js`.

Output should look like:
```code
query result MessageReply {
  status: { code: 200, detail: 'OK' },
  entries: [
    {
      recordId: 'bafyreihboydeogzumlfgndtttv6skx6nbipuitoxqi4akw6jqksmb5re24',
      descriptor: [Object],
      encodedData: 'SGVsbG8gV2ViNQ'
    }
  ],
  data: undefined
}
```
