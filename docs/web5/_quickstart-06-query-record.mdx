## 4. Querying and Reading: 

### `web5.dwn.records.query`:
Querying a DWN allows you to search records depending on the filter params you pass to it. In the code snippet below, we're querying a DWN for messages that have a MIME type of text/plain. Note that you don't have to query based on MIME type, there are many different attributes you can use to query, such as protocol, schema, contextId, etc.

Add this to `index.js`:
```js
const queryResult = await web5.dwn.records.query(did.id, {
    author: did.id,
    message: {
        filter: {
          dataFormat: 'text/plain',
        },
    },
});
```
## Test this out:
### Option 1. In `index.js`:
Add `console.log('query result', queryResult);`

Output should look like:
```code
query result {
  status: { code: 200, detail: 'OK' },
  entries: [ _Record {} ],
  data: undefined,
  message: {
    recordId: null,
    descriptor: {
      interface: 'Records',
      method: 'Query',
      dateCreated: '2023-04-25T18:52:46.648765Z',
      filter: [Object]
    }
  }
}
```
