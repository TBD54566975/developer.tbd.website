## 5. Query DWN Records

Querying a DWN allows you to search records depending on the filter params you pass to it. In the code snippet below, we're querying a DWN for messages that have a MIME type of `text/plain`. 

:::note
You don't have to query based on MIME type, there are many different attributes you can use to query, such as protocol, schema, contextId, etc.
:::

Add the following to `index.js`:
```js
const queryResult = await web5.dwn.records.query(did.id, {
    author: did.id,
    message: {
        filter: {
          dataFormat: 'text/plain',
        },
    },
});
```

<p>
To see the DWN records that have the <code>text/plain</code> data format, add the following line to <code>index.js</code>:

```js
console.log('query result', queryResult);
```

  Then from the terminal, run:
  ```bash
  node src/index.js
  ```

Your output will resemble:

```js
query result {
  status: { code: 200, detail: 'OK' },
  entries: [ _Record {} ],
  data: undefined,
  message: {
    recordId: null,
    descriptor: {
      interface: 'Records',
      method: 'Query',
      dateCreated: '2023-04-25T18:52:46.648765Z',
      filter: [Object]
    }
  }
}
```
