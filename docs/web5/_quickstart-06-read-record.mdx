## 6. Read DWN Records

If the user has given your app read permissions to their DWN, you can read specific records using a `recordId`. In the code snippet below, we are using the `queryResult` from above to obtain the `recordId`:

Add the following to `index.js`:
```js
const readResult = await myRecord.record.data.text();
```

<details>
<summary>Test your code</summary>
<p>
To see the record that was read from the DWN, add the following to <code>index.js</code>:

```js
console.log('Read result: ', readResult);
```

The output will resemble:

```js
Read result: Hello Web5
```

</p>
</details>
