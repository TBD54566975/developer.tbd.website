## 5. Delete, `web5.dwn.records.delete`:

And lastly, here is how you can delete data from a DWN if you have permission to do so. Similar to reading, weâ€™re using the `recordId` to remove the record.

Add this to `index.js`:
```js
let deleteResult = await web5.dwn.records.delete(did.id, {
    author: did.id,
    message: {
        recordId: queryResult.entries[0].recordId,
        },
    });
console.log('delete result', deleteResult);
```

Run `index.js` in terminal:
<pre>node src/index.js</pre>

Output should look like this:
```code
delete result MessageReply {
  status: { code: 202, detail: 'Accepted' },
  entries: undefined,
  data: undefined
}
```

### Play around without opening terminal, click `Run!` one last time to delete the data stored, `web5.dwn.records.delete`:
