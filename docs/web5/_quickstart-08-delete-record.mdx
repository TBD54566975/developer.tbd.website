## 7. Delete DWN Records

Given permission from the user, your app can delete records from their DWN. Similar to reading, weâ€™ll use the `recordId` to remove a record.

Add the following to `index.js`:
```js
const deleteResult = await web5.dwn.records.delete(did.id, {
    author: did.id,
    message: {
        recordId: queryResult.entries[0].id,
    },
});
```

<details>
<summary>Test your code</summary>
<p>
To see the record that was deleted from the DWN, add the following to <code>index.js</code>:

```js
console.log('delete result', deleteResult);
```

The output will resemble:

```js
delete result MessageReply {
  status: { code: 202, detail: 'Accepted' },
  entries: undefined,
  data: undefined,
  message: {
    recordId: null,
    descriptor: {
      interface: 'Records',
      method: 'Delete',
      recordId: 'bafyreicc65viceyqtl7sjdxbbxpuvs2nlagerzcblje2lvfhzqbmg4pqhm',
      dateModified: '2023-04-25T18:52:46.666766Z'
    }
  }
}
```
