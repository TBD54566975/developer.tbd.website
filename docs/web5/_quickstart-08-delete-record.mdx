## 5. Delete, `web5.dwn.records.delete`:

And lastly, here is how you can delete data from a DWN if you have permission to do so. Similar to reading, weâ€™re using the `recordId` to remove the record.

Add this to `index.js`:
```js
const deleteResult = await web5.dwn.records.delete(did.id, {
    author: did.id,
    message: {
        recordId: queryResult.entries[0].id,
    },
});
```
## Test this out:
### Option 1. In `index.js`:
Add `console.log('delete result', deleteResult);`

Output should look like:
```code
delete result MessageReply {
  status: { code: 202, detail: 'Accepted' },
  entries: undefined,
  data: undefined,
  message: {
    recordId: null,
    descriptor: {
      interface: 'Records',
      method: 'Delete',
      recordId: 'bafyreicc65viceyqtl7sjdxbbxpuvs2nlagerzcblje2lvfhzqbmg4pqhm',
      dateModified: '2023-04-25T18:52:46.666766Z'
    }
  }
}
```
