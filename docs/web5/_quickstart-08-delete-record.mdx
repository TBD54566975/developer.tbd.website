### 7. Delete DWN Records

Given permission from the user, your app can delete records from their DWN. Similar to reading, weâ€™ll use the `record` object to remove the record.

Add the following to `index.js`:
```js
const deleteResult = await record.delete();
```

<details>
<summary>Test your code</summary>
<p>
To see the status of the delete transaction, add the following to <code>index.js</code>:

```js
console.log('Delete result: ', deleteResult.status);
```

The output will resemble:

```js
Delete result: { code: 202, detail: 'Accepted' },
```

</p>
</details>

#### Try it!
