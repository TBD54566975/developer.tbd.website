## 5. Delete, `web5.dwn.records.delete`:

And lastly, here is how you can delete data from a DWN if you have permission to do so. Similar to reading, weâ€™re using the `recordId` to remove the record.

Add this to `index.js`:
```js
const deleteResult = await web5.dwn.records.delete(did.id, {
  author: did.id,
  message: {
    recordId: queryResult.entries[0].recordId,
  },
});
```
:::note
To see the data deleted add `console.log('delete result', deleteResult);` to `index.js` and in terminal run `node src/index.js`.

Output should look like:
```code
delete result MessageReply {
  status: { code: 202, detail: 'Accepted' },
  entries: undefined,
  data: undefined
}
```
