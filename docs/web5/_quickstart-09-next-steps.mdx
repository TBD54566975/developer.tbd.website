# Summary

Click <a href="/static/tutorial/index.js" download>here</a> to download what your final index.js file should look like after all steps above.

Congrats! You've just created a local DWN to serve as your user's
personal data store. Given a user's DID and appropriate permissions,
your app can read, write, or delete data from the user's DWN, while
leaving them full control of their content. Other apps can query local
storage to determine if the user already has a DWN on their device, and
can also read and write from this same data store - essentially, making
the user's data portable across multiple applications.

## Next Steps:
### 1. Learn more about [DIDs](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers)
### 2. Learn more about [DWNs](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes)
### 3. Build a decentralized [ToDo app](/docs/web5/build/apps/todo-app-tutorial)
