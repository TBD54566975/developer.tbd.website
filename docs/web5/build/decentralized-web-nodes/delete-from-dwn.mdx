# Delete Data from a Decentralized Web Node

Before deleting from your Decentralized Web Node (DWN), be sure to check out our [Quickstart guide](../../quickstart) to ensure you’ve properly imported the Web5 SDK. Additionally, make sure you’ve set up a DID before attempting to delete from a DWN.

## Deleting from a DWN

The following snippet allows you to delete from your Web5 instance’s DWN:

```jsx
// Create the record
const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.create({
    data: "Hello Web5",
    message: {
        dataFormat: 'text/plain',
    },
});
// Delete the record
const deleteResult = await record.delete();
```
