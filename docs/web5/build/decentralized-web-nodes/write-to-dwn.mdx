# Write to Decentralized Web Nodes

Before writing to your Decentralized Web Node (DWN), be sure to check out our [Quickstart guide](../../quickstart) to ensure you’ve properly imported the Web5 SDK. Additionally, make sure you’ve set up a DID before attempting to write to a DWN.

## Write to a DWN

The following snippet allows you to write to your `Web5` instance’s DWN using a DID object called `myDid`:

```jsx
// Write a plain text record to the in-memory DWN

const myRecord = await web5.dwn.records.create(myDid.id, {
  author: myDid.id,
  data: "Hello Web5",
  message: {
      dataFormat: 'text/plain',
  },
});
```

The write `request` must contain the following:

- **`author`** - *`string`*: The decentralized identifier of the DID signing the query. This may be the same as the `target` parameter if the target and the signer of the query are the same entity, which is common for an app querying the DWeb Node of its own user.
- **`message`** - *`object`*: The properties of the DWeb Node Message Descriptor that will be used to construct a valid DWeb Node message. `schema`, is an optional parameter, and if used it does not need to be a resolvable url. `dataFormat` should conform to one of the [IANA media types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).
- **`data`** - *`blob | stream | file`*: The data object of the bytes to be sent.
