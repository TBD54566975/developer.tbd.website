## 🎤 From a First-time Contributor

I remember my first-time contribution jitters. Every step felt like a monumental task, and the fear of making a mistake? Oh boy! Here’s a snippet from my Twitter thread on my first contribution experience:

You can check out my complete thread and the roller-coaster of emotions I went through [here](https://twitter.com/EbonyJLouis/status/1445864374762020866). If I could do it, trust me so can you!

> **Hot Tip**: Pair up with someone from our [`hack-together`](https://discord.com/invite/tbd) channel on Discord. Two heads (or more) are always better than one.
