# Creating Quotes

When you receive an `RFQ` message, you’ll want to do the following:

1. Store the `RFQ` message in your database
2. Get the `Offering` specified by `offeringId` in the `RFQ`
3. Create a `Quote` and store it in your database

## Store RFQ message

An `RFQ` is the first message of an exchange. 
When a Wallet application sends your PFI an `RFQ` message, your server's `onCreateExchange()` callback parameter will be invoked.
This is where you should implement your business logic for determining the customer's exact Quote. 

As a best practice, store the `RFQ` message in your [Exchanges database](/docs/tbdex/pfi/anatomy-of-a-pfi#main-server-entrypoint) so that both you and the Wallet app can access it.


## Get the Offering

After inserting the `RFQ` into your database, you can search your database for the `Offering` the `RFQ` is requesting. 

RFQs contain a required `offeringId` field that you pass to your Offerings API provider’s `getOffering()` method to obtain the exact Offering. 

Building on the example from the [Exchange API Provider section](/docs/tbdex/pfi/anatomy-of-a-pfi#exchange-api-provider), your code might look like this:

## Verify Credentials

Upon receiving an `RFQ`, the tbDEX SDK will automatically [verify the submitted credentials](/docs/web5/build/verifiable-credentials/verify-vc#verify-verifiable-credentials) to guarantee their integrity and authenticity as well as ensure that they meet the `requiredClaims` specified in the `Offering`. 

## Create a Quote

Before creating a `Quote` in response to the received `RFQ`, you can review the [protocol definition for Quotes](https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/tree/main/specs/protocol#quote). 
With that in mind, you can then create your quote using the `Quote.create()` method as shown below:


With the `Quote` created, you’ll then sign it for authorization purposes and write it to your own database:

:::tip Note
If the Wallet Application supplied a `replyTo` address with their RFQ, the tbDEX SDK will send the Quote to that address.

If not, the Wallet Application will poll your PFI awaiting the Quote message to appear within the exchange.
