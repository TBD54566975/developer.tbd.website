# Issuing a Known Business Credential

Known Business Credentials (KBC) are [Verifiable Credentials](/docs/web5/verifiable-credentials/what-are-vcs) designed to streamline the Know Your Business (KYB) process for tbDEX protocol users. 

By issuing this credential, the PFI attests to the businessâ€™s legitimacy and compliance with regulations, allowing the PFI to engage in financial activities with the Wallet application without requiring individual KYC for each customer.

:::danger Important
This guide is intended for educational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Compliance programs may have varying requirements. Consult your legal and/or compliance advisors to ensure that the KBC is consistent with your legal and compliance obligations.
:::

In this guide, we'll cover how to:
- Design and issue a KBC
- Specify a KBC as a required claim in an [Offering](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/tbdex/pfi/creating-offerings)

## Environment Setup

If you haven't already, please follow the [Credential Issuance Server Setup Guide](/docs/tbdex/issuer/vc-serverSetup) for detailed instructions on the dependencies and packages needed to set up your server.

## Issue Credential

To issue a KBC, call `VerifiableCredential.create()` and pass in the URL to the credential schema the VC is based on. 

We've designed an open source schema for KBCs that you're welcome to use at https://vc.schemas.host/kbc.schema.json.

    {
      snippetName: 'issueKbcJs',
      language: 'JavaScript',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'issueKbcKt',
      language: 'Kotlin',
    }
  ]}
/>

In the example above, `signedKbc` is a [token](/docs/web5/verifiable-credentials/jwt-to-vc#what-is-a-jwt) that you can safely provide to the business you're issuing the KBC to.

## Specify KBC as Requirement

If you issue a KBC to a business, you'll want to specify that credential as a [required claim](/docs/tbdex/pfi/creating-offerings#required-claims) on any applicable Offerings you may provide. 

:::note
The `id` property is a string that uniquely identifies the `input_descriptor`. It is required and must be unique within the `presentation_definition`.

### Create Presentation Definition

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    {
      snippetName: 'kbcPresentationDefinitionJs',
      language: 'JavaScript',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'kbcPresentationDefinitionKt',
      language: 'Kotlin',
    }
  ]}
/>

## Add Required Claim to Offering

Now that you've defined your requirements, you can add them to any relevant Offerings.

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    {
      snippetName: 'kbcCreateOfferingJs',
      language: 'JavaScript',
    },
        {
      snippetName: 'kbcCreateOfferingKt',
      language: 'Kotlin',
    },
  ]}
