# Credential Issuance Server Setup

<LanguageSwitcher languages={["JavaScript", "Kotlin"]}>
  <LanguageContent language="Kotlin">

## Setup Ktor Project

This example demonstrates how to use Ktor to set up the VC issuance service. Follow these instructions to [create a new Ktor project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/ktor.html#new_ktor_project).

  <LanguageContent language="JavaScript">

## Install Express

This example demonstrates how to use Express to set up the VC issuance service. Follow these instructions to [install Express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html).

  </LanguageContent>
</LanguageSwitcher>

### Install Credentials Package

You'll also need to install `@web5/credentials` to create and issue credentials:

<Dependencies
  languageDependencies={[
    { language: "javascript", dependencies: ["@web5/credentials"] },
    { language: "maven", dependencies: ["web5-credentials"] },
    { language: "gradle", dependencies: ["web5-credentials"] },
  ]}
/>

### Create a DID

Additionally, to issue credentials, you need a [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/what-are-dids) which will serve as your Issuer's identity.

If you don't already have one, you'll need to [create a DID](/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did) with an IDV (Identity Verification) service endpoint:

<Shnip
  languages={["JavaScript", "Kotlin"]}
  snippetName="createADidWithServiceEndpoint"
/>

If you have an existing DID you'll need to update that DID Document with an IDV service endpoint:

<Shnip
  languages={["JavaScript", "Kotlin"]}
  snippetName="updateADidWithServiceEndpoint"
  inlineSnippets={[
    {
      code: `Updating a DID Document with a service endpoint is not currently supported in Kotlin.`,
      language: "Kotlin",
      codeLanguage: "text",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Create API Service

<LanguageSwitcher languages={["JavaScript", "Kotlin"]}>
  <LanguageContent language="Kotlin">

1. Ensure you have a file, such as `Application.kt`, to act as your API's entry point, which was created during the Ktor setup.

2. Within the file, import the necessary libraries:

   ```kotlin title=Application.kt
   import com.nimbusds.jwt.JWTParser
   import io.ktor.server.application.*
   import io.ktor.server.response.*
   import io.ktor.server.request.*
   import io.ktor.server.routing.*
   import io.ktor.http.*
   import io.ktor.server.engine.*
   import io.ktor.server.netty.*
   import web5.sdk.credentials.VerifiableCredential
   import java.security.SignatureException
   import com.nimbusds.jwt.JWTClaimsSet
   import web5.sdk.dids.Did
   ```

3. To start your API service, add the following:

   ```kotlin title=Application.kt
   fun main() {
     embeddedServer(Netty, port = 8082) { // this can be any port you want to listen on
         configureRouting()
     }.start(wait = true)
   }
   ```

4. In the same file, define your API routes:

   ```kotlin title=Application.kt
   fun Application.configureRouting() {
       routing {
           get("/example-route") {
             // implement the API route here
           }
           get("/next-example-route") {
             // implement the API route here
           }
       }
   }
   ```

  </LanguageContent>

  <LanguageContent language="JavaScript">

1. Ensure you have a file, such as `main.js`, to act as your API's entry point, which was created during the Express setup.

2. Within the file, import the following:

   ```javascript title=main.js
   import { api } from "./api.js";
   ```

3. To start your Express API service, add the following:

   ```javascript title=main.js
   const config = {
     port: 3000, // this can be any port you want to listen on
   };

   const server = api.listen(config.port, () => {
     console.log(`Server listening on port ${config.port}`);
   });
   ```

4. Next, create an `api.js` file. This file will define the core API routes and logic for issuing credentials:

   ```javascript title=api.js
   import express from "express";
   import { VerifiableCredential, Jwt } from "@web5/credentials";

   const app = express();
   app.use(express.json());

   app.get("/example-route", async (req, res) => {
     // implement the API route here
   });

   // Export the app so it can be imported in your main.js file
   export { app as api };
   ```

Now that you have your server environment set up, depending on your use case, you can proceed with one of the following guides:
