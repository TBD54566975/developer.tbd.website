# Sending RFQs

After your customer selects an [Offering](/docs/tbdex/pfi/creating-offerings), the next step is to send a **Request for Quote (RFQ)** to the PFI in order to initiate the transaction.

The Offering provided an estimate, but the Quote will provide a formal offer based on the financial transaction the customer is requesting as well as the payment methods provided.

## Create the RFQ

An RFQ is a structured tbDEX message that specifies the details of the transaction your customer wishes to make.

It includes information about the Offering, payment methods, and any required [verifiable credentials (VCs)](/docs/tbdex/wallet/managing-credentials).

To create the message, construct an RFQ passing metadata and data:

<Shnip
  languages={["JavaScript", "Kotlin", "Swift"]}
  snippetName="skeletonRfqMessage"
/>

### metadata

The metadata properties identify the DIDs of the sender (your customer), the recipient (the PFI), and the version of the tbDEX protocol you're using:

<Shnip
  languages={["JavaScript", "Kotlin", "Swift"]}
  snippetName="rfqMetadata"
/>

### data

The data properties contain the specifics of the transaction, such as the id of the Offering you're requesting the Quote for, payment methods, and credentials:

- **offeringId** - The unique identifier of the PFI's Offering the customer is interested in
- **payin** - How the customer intends to pay the PFI
  - **kind** - Type of payment method e.g. BTC_ADDRESS, DEBIT_CARD, MOMO_MPESA
  - **amount** - Total amount of currency the customer wants to pay in exchange for payout currency
  - **paymentDetails** - The exact details of the payment method. As this information is sensitive, the SDK will convert these details into [salted hashes](https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/tree/main/specs/protocol#privatedata-1)
- **payout** - How the customer wishes to receive the payout from the PFI
  - **kind** - Type of payment method e.g. BTC_ADDRESS, BANK_ACCOUNT, MOMO_MPESA
  - **paymentDetails** - The exact details of the payment method. As this information is sensitive, the SDK will convert these details into [salted hashes](https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/tree/main/specs/protocol#privatedata-1)
- **claims** - The [VCs that satisfy the requirements of the Offer](/docs/tbdex/wallet/managing-credentials#select-credentials-that-satisfy-requirements). As this information is sensitive, the SDK will convert these details into [salted hashes](https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/tree/main/specs/protocol#privatedata-1)

<Shnip
  languages={["JavaScript", "Kotlin", "Swift"]}

## Verify RFQ Data

Before sending the RFQ to the PFI, you can verify that the `data` within the RFQ satisfies the Offering's requirements.

<Shnip
  languages={["JavaScript", "Kotlin"]}
  snippetName="verifyOfferingRequirements"
  inlineSnippets={[
    {
      code: "// verifyOfferings() is not available in the Swift SDK",
      language: "Swift",
    },
  ]}
/>

This will throw an error for any of the following:

- `data.offeringId` doesn't match the provided Offering's id
- `data.payin.amount` exceeds the provided Offering's max units allowed or is below the Offering's min units allowed
- `data.payin.kind` does not match the provided Offering's payin kinds
- `data.payout.kind` does not match the provided Offering's payout kinds
- `data.payin.paymentDetails` doesn't satisfy the Offering's `requiredPaymentDetails`
- `data.payout.paymentDetails` doesn't satisfy the Offering's `requiredPaymentDetails`
- `data.claims` does not contain JWTs for VCs that match the Offering's `requiredClaims`

**Example error output**

> Error: offering does not support rfq's payinMethod kind. (rfq) BTC_ADDRESS was not found in: [BANK_ACCOUNT] (offering)

## Sign the RFQ

Signing the RFQ ensures its authenticity. You can do so with the customer's [Bearer DID](/docs/glossary#bearer-did):

<Shnip
  languages={["JavaScript", "Kotlin", "Swift"]}
  snippetName="signRfqMessage"
/>

## Send RFQ to PFI

Use `TbdexHttpClient` to send the RFQ to the PFI. If no error is thrown, the RFQ has been successfully sent to the PFI and an **exchange** has been created.

This exchange serves as a thread of messages between your application and the PFI regarding this transaction.

<Shnip
  languages={["JavaScript", "Kotlin", "Swift"]}
  snippetName="sendRfqMessage"
/>

The next message written to the exchange will be a [Quote](/docs/tbdex/wallet/receive-quote) from the PFI.

You'll need to [poll the PFI](/docs/tbdex/wallet/receive-quote#polling-for-quote) to receive the `Quote` and all other messages within the exchange, unless you provide an `replyTo` callback when sending the RFQ.

### Optional Callback

If your wallet application has a deployed server, you can provide a callback when sending the RFQ.

Callbacks are fully qualified URIs (DID or URL) that can be provided to the PFI via the optional `replyTo` property.

If `replyTo` is provided, the PFI will send all new messages of the exchange to the supplied URI.

This URI is scoped to each exchange, allowing you to specify a different URI per exchange if desired.

:::tip No Callback

If a callback is not provided, you'll need to [poll the PFI](/docs/tbdex/wallet/receive-quote#polling-for-quote) to receive the `Quote` and all other messages within the exchange.

#### Callback as a URL

<Shnip
  languages={["JavaScript", "Kotlin"]}
  snippetName="rfqWithUrlReplyTo"
  inlineSnippets={[
    {
      code: "// replyTo is not available in the Swift SDK",
      language: "Swift",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Callback as a DID

To provide your wallet application's DID as the `replyTo` property, it must have a service type of `tbdex`.

<Shnip
  languages={["JavaScript", "Kotlin"]}
  snippetName="createDidWithTbdexService"
  inlineSnippets={[
    {
      code: "// replyTo is not available in the Swift SDK",
      language: "Swift",
    },
  ]}
/>

To use your DID as the `replyTo`, you'll provide its `uri`.

<Shnip
  languages={["JavaScript", "Kotlin"]}
  snippetName="rfqWithDidReplyTo"
  inlineSnippets={[
    {
      code: "// replyTo is not available in the Swift SDK",
      language: "Swift",
    },
  ]}
/>
