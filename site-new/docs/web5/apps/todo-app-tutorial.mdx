In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a basic single-party decentralized ToDo app built using `web5.js`. It’s composed of a `Vue.js` app powered by [web5.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web5/api) which adds data storage underpinned by a [Decentralized Web Node](/docs/web5/decentralized-web-nodes/what-are-dwns) (DWN).

The ToDo app is a basic single-user, local application that only leverages `web5.js` for storage purposes, but serves as an important precursor to building larger decentralized apps.

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a solid understanding of the basics of creating, reading, and writing to a DWN and will be on your way to creating serverless, decentralized applications.

## Getting the Skeleton App

Download a copy of the skeleton ToDo app by running:

Note: If you don't have `pnpm` installed, you can install it by running `npm install -g pnpm`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbd-examples.git
cd tbd-examples/javascript/todo-starter
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

In this tutorial, you’ll work through completing the `src/App.vue` file under `/examples/tutorials/todo-starter` to use `web5.js`.

## Setup

Add `Web5` to package.json in the `dependencies` section:

<PackageJson />

Download the necessary packages by running these commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

You should now have the app running on `https://localhost:5173`; this will be a starter application with a mostly blank page. In this tutorial, we'll build the rest.

## App Architecture

There are 3 main components to your ToDo app: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The way that `web5.js` changes the layout of your ToDo app compared to the way a traditional web app would be laid out is by replacing the RESTful calls you’d normally make with calls to the DWN.

:::note
Think of `web5.js` as your storage, RESTful API service, and the backing data store.
:::

Because we’ve built this sample app using `Vue.js`, you’ll find both the HTML structure of the app and the JS logic within the `App.vue` file. Your ToDo app will have a few main responsibilities to implement:

- Create a new DWN for the user or load their saved DWN for storage
- Display ToDos
- Create ToDos
- Delete ToDos
- Toggle ToDo status

## Initialize Constants and Variables

Open `src/App.vue` in your editor and add this next to the other imports:
```js
import { Web5 } from "@web5/api";
```

First we'll set up instances to hold data you'll use throughout your application.

Copy the following block and paste under all `import` statements in `src/App.vue`:

```js
let web5;
let myDid;
const todos = ref([]);
```

The `web5` object is the single entry point for all Web5 operations. You've also set up a `todos` array to hold your ToDos, and a variable to remember the app user's decentralized identifier (DID) as `myDid`.

## Create DID and Web5 Instance

The first time a user accesses your ToDo app, you’ll need to handle creating an “account” for them - this means ensuring they have a DID and DWN available to access their app data. Once they come back for subsequent sessions, you’ll want to fetch and load that data for them.

Add to `src/App.vue`:

```js
onBeforeMount(async () => {
  ({ web5, did: myDid } = await Web5.connect());
});
```

## Displaying Todos

You can now make calls to the DWN to fetch, write, and delete data. To load your user’s existing ToDos, call:

```js
onBeforeMount(async () => {
  ...
  // Populate ToDos from DWN
  const { records } = await web5.dwn.records.query({
    message: {
      filter: {
        schema: 'http://some-schema-registry.org/todo'
      },
      dateSort: 'createdAscending'
    }
  });
});
```

Once you’ve loaded the query data, you can map this data from the DWN into an object for your app to use:

```js
onBeforeMount(async () => {
  ...
  // Add entry to ToDos array
  for (let record of records) {
    const data = await record.data.json();
    const todo = { record, data, id: record.id };
    todos.value.push(todo);
  }
});
```

Now that your app user's ToDos are stored in their DWN, you can display them by using the `todos` object. In this example, you can do it by adding the following HTML code to the Vue app below the JS, just as you would in any non-Web5 app.

In the template where you see `<!-- ToDos -->` add this:

```jsx
<div v-if="(todos.length > 0)" class="border-gray-200 border-t border-x mt-16 rounded-lg shadow-md sm:max-w-xl sm:mx-auto sm:w-full">
  <div v-for="todo in todos" :key="todo" class="border-b border-gray-200 flex items-center p-4">
    <div @click="toggleTodoComplete(todo)" class="cursor-pointer">
      <CheckCircleIcon class="h-8 text-gray-200 w-8" :class="{ 'text-green-500': todo.data.completed }" />
    </div>
    <div class="font-light ml-3 text-gray-500 text-xl">
      {{ todo.data.description }}
    </div>
    <!-- Delete ToDo goes here later -->
  </div>
</div>
```

:::info
Note that this UI code fulfills more than just loading the ToDos - it also provides the ability to toggle completion status and delete ToDos, which we’ll get to in a bit.
:::

## Adding ToDos

To allow for add functionality, begin by creating the UI needed to add ToDos.

In the template add this code block to `<!-- Add ToDos Form -->`:
```jsx
<div class="mt-16">
  <form class="flex space-x-4" @submit.prevent="addTodo">
    <div class="border-b border-gray-200 sm:w-full">
      <label for="add-todo" class="sr-only">Add a todo</label>
      <textarea
        rows="1" name="add-todo" id="add-todo" v-model="newTodoDescription"
        @keydown.enter.exact.prevent="addTodo"
        class="block border-0 border-transparent focus:ring-0 p-0 pb-2 resize-none sm:text-sm w-96"
        placeholder="Add a Todo" />
    </div>
    <button type="submit" class="bg-indigo-600 border border-transparent focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-indigo-500 focus:ring-offset-2 hover:bg-indigo-700 inline-flex items-center p-1 rounded-full shadow-sm text-white">
      <PlusIconMini class="h-5 w-5" aria-hidden="true" />
    </button>
  </form>
</div>
```

Next, you can add a Todo to storage by binding a `addTodo()` method to the UI and leveraging the `newTodoDescription` model referenced in the `textarea` to call the `web5` method `dwn.records.create`:

```js
// Adding ToDos
const newTodoDescription = ref('');

async function addTodo() {
  const todoData = {
    completed   : false,
    description : newTodoDescription.value
  };

  newTodoDescription.value = '';

  // Create the record in DWN
  const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.create({
    data    : todoData,
    message : {
      schema     : 'http://some-schema-registry.org/todo',
      dataFormat : 'application/json'
    }
  });
}
```

This code uses the `myDid` object we loaded or created in the `onBeforeMount` function and uses it to write into the DWN that `web5` is using to store your app user's data.

Once we’ve written the data to storage, we’ll use the returned `record` to create your app's `todo` object, passing along the `record.id` :

```js
async function addTodo() {
...
  // add DWeb message recordId as a way to reference the message for further operations
  // e.g. updating it or overwriting it
  const data = await record.data.json();
  const todo = { record, data, id: record.id };
  todos.value.push(todo);
}
```

## Deleting ToDos

Deleting ToDos can be done by using the `deleteTodo` method, passing the `todoItem`:

```js
// Delete ToDo
async function deleteTodo(todoItem) {
  let deletedTodo;
  let index = 0;

  for (let todo of todos.value) {
    if (todoItem.id === todo.id) {
      deletedTodo = todo;
      break;
    }
    index ++;
  }

  todos.value.splice(index, 1);

  // Delete the record in DWN
  await web5.dwn.records.delete({
    message: {
      recordId: deletedTodo.id
    }
  });
}
```

We’ll connect that to the UI with the following code. This replaces the `<!-- Delete ToDo goes here later -->` comment we added earlier:

```jsx
<div class="ml-auto">
  <div @click="deleteTodo(todo)" class="cursor-pointer">
    <TrashIcon class="h-8 text-gray-200 w-8" :class="'text-red-500'" />
  </div>
</div>
```

## Toggling ToDo Status

To toggle a ToDo’s status, you’ll need to change its status both in your local `todos` object and in your web5-managed DWN. You can do so by modifying the `todos` object and then using a `record.update` call to update the ToDo in your data store:

```js
// Toggling ToDo Status
async function toggleTodoComplete(todoItem) {
  let toggledTodo;
  let updatedTodoData;

  for (let todo of todos.value) {
    if (todoItem.id === todo.id) {
      toggledTodo = todo;
      todo.data.completed = !todo.data.completed;
      updatedTodoData = { ...toRaw(todo.data) };
      break;
    }
  }

  // Get record in DWN
  const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.read({
    message: {
      filter: {
        recordId: toggledTodo.id
      }
    }
  });

  // Update the record in DWN
  await record.update({ data: updatedTodoData });
}
```
