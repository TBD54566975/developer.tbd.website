# Reuse a DID

In this guide, you will learn how to take your [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/what-are-dids) with you to other apps, allowing you to keep your identity consistent across various applications. 

## Export DID
You will start by exporting your [Bearer DID](/docs/glossary#bearer-did). This method returns a JSON object called a [Portable DID](/docs/glossary#portable-did), which is a serialized version of your Bearer DID suitable for storage or transfer.

:::note
Your Portable DID contains private key material. Always [store it securely](/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/key-management), preferably in a trusted identity wallet or password manager.

## Import DID
You can import your Portable DID to an application using the `import` method. 

This converts your Portable DID back into a fully functional Bearer DID, allowing you to use it for various operations, including signing and verifying data.
