# Query DWN Records

You can use the `query` function to obtain records and protocols from a DWN. This guide shows how to do both, as well as how to sort the query results.

:::tip
Querying a DWN is analogous to querying a database, and the flow of a query is similar to an SQL select statement.

A query can be read as _**select** records with a **filter** of X **from** the DWN of this DID_.
:::


## Querying Protocols

The following snippet queries the local DWN for protocols that match a given schema:

<CodeSnippet snippetName="queryProtocolsForMusic" />

## Querying Records

The following snippet queries a given DWN for records that match a given schema and are in a specific data format.

> Note the `from` property used here. Much like SQL, where the `FROM` command is used to specify which table to select data from, in Web5, `from` specifies which DWN to query.

<CodeSnippet snippetName="queryRecordsFromDid" />


:::note
`records.query()` does not guarantee that the data is returned unless it is under a specific threshold (50 kb).
To guarantee record data, call [records.read()](https://tbd54566975.github.io/web5-js/classes/_web5_api.DwnApi.html#records).

## Filterable Record Properties
Here are the properties you can use to filter your record query, along with explanations and examples for each.

| Property            | Value                                                |   Example   |
| -----------         | ----------                                           | ----------- |
| **`recipient`**     | Recipient DID of message                             | "did:example:alice"  |
| **`protocol`**      | The URI of the protocol bucket in which to query     | "example.com" |
| **`protocolPath`**  | Records under a protocol path across all context IDs | "example" |
| **`contextId`**     | `recordId` of a root record of a protocol            | "bafyreianzpmhbgcgam5mys722vnsiuwn..." |
| **`schema`**        | The URI of the schema bucket in which to query       | "https<span>://</span>schema.org/Message" |
| **`recordId`**      | Property contains the message recordId               | "aa36ec55-c59b-4f20-8143-10f74aac696d" |
| **`parentId`**      | `recordId` of the parent record in a protocol        | "iadsfdreianzpmasdffcgam5mys722vnd..." |
| **`dataFormat`**    | The IANA string for the data format to filter        | "application/json" |
| **`dateCreated`**   | Date the record was created                          | "2023-04-30T22:49:37.713976Z" |
| **`tags`**          | User-defined key-value pairs for categorizing records| `{"genre": "Action", "year": "2024"}`|

### Filter by parentId
This snippet queries the DWN for records that have a parent record with a specific record ID:

<CodeSnippet snippetName="queryRecordWithParentId" />

### Filter by protocol and protocolPath
Given the following protocol definition is installed:

<details>
<summary>Playlist Protocol Definition</summary>

<CodeSnippet snippetName="playlistProtocolDefinition" />

</details>

And assuming `playlist` and `video` records have been created using this protocol, the following snippet demonstrates how to query for video records that match the protocol:

<CodeSnippet snippetName="queryFromDwnByProtocolPath" />

## Sorting Query Results

Query results can be sorted via the `dateSort` field. Valid values for `dateSort` are:

| Value                     | Sorts Results By | Order       |
| -----------               | -----------      | ----------- |
| **createdAscending**      | `dateCreated`    | ascending   |
| **createdDescending**     | `dateCreated`    | descending  |
| **publishedAscending**    | `datePublished`  | ascending   |
| **publishedDescending**   | `datePublished`  | descending  |

### Ascending Order

This code snippet queries for records with a plain text data format, and returns them in ascending order by the date they were [published](/docs/web5/decentralized-web-nodes/publishing-records):

<CodeSnippet snippetName="queryRecordsWithFilterAscending"/>

### Descending Order

This code snippet queries for protocols with a certain URL, and returns them in descending order by the date they were created.

<CodeSnippet snippetName="queryProtocolsWithFilterDescending" />
