# Presentation Definition

If you accept verifiable credentials, you'll want to define what sort of information is necessary to meet the requirements.
This specification of expected claims is a **Presentation Definition** (PD).

For example, assume an Employer accepts verifiable credentials as part of a job application.
The presentation definition would specify exactly what the Employer will look for in those credentials.
This could include things like proof of a degree, past employment history, and maybe a specific certification.

They're essentially saying, "To consider your application, we need to see these specific pieces of information."

## Designing a Presentation Definition

An employer decides that an applicant must provide proof of:

* employment history
* degree in a field related to Engineering, Computer Science, or Security
* Certified Ethical Hacker certification issued by a specific trusted organization


### Example Presentation Definition
To represent these requirements, the employer creates the PD.

<details open>
<summary>Presentation Definition</summary>

```js
{
  "id": "PD_JobApplication_123456",
  "name": "Credentials Verification for Ethical Hacker Job Application",
  "purpose": "To verify the applicant's employment history, and either their academic degree or Certified Ethical Hacker certification",
  "input_descriptors": [
    {
      "id": "employmentHistoryVerification",
      "name": "Employment History",
      "purpose": "Verify the applicant's previous employment experiences",
      "constraints": {
        "fields": [
          {
            "path": ["$.type[*]"],
            "filter": {
              "type": "string",
              "pattern": "Employment"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "degreeVerification",

            "filter": {
              "type": "string",
              "pattern": "(Engineering|Computer|Cyber|Security)"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "CEH_CertificationVerification",
      "name": "Certified Ethical Hacker Certification",
      "purpose": "Confirm the applicant holds a Certified Ethical Hacker certification",
      "constraints": {
        "fields": [

            "path": ["$.vc.credentialSubject.certifications[*].name"],
            "filter": {
              "type": "string",
              "pattern": "Certified Ethical Hacker"
            }
          },
          {
            "path": ["$.issuer"],
            "filter": {
              "type": "string",
              "const": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Properties

The following are the top-level properties of a PD:

* [id](#id): A required unique identifier that distinguishes this PD from others
* [name](#name-and-purpose): An optional, human-friendly name for easier identification of the PD
* [purpose](#name-and-purpose):  An optional description outlining why the information requested by the PD is needed
* [format](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v1.0.0/#claim-format-designations):  The optional technical format requirements for the data to be submitted. *Example: \{ "jwt_vc": \{"alg": ["ES256K", "ES384"]} }*
* [input_descriptors](#input_selectors):  This is the most important property of the PD. It details the exact data requirements

For more in-depth information on the schema and options, refer to the [Presentation Definition spec](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v1.0.0/#json-schema-2).
:::

### Breakdown of PD

Let's break down the creation of each part:

#### id

To keep the IDs unique, the Employer uses a format within their system: 'PD_JobApplication' followed by the ID of the job req. This allows them to easily match PDs with their open roles.

```js
{
  "id": "PD_JobApplication_123456",
}
```

#### name and purpose

The `name` and `purpose` are clear and human-readable, as they may be presented to the applicant when they need to decide if to share their credentials with the employer.

```js
{
  "id": "PD_JobApplication_123456",
  //highlight-start
  "name": "Credentials Verification for Ethical Hacker Job Application",
  "purpose": "To verify the applicant's employment history, and either their academic degree or Certified Ethical Hacker certification",
  //highlight-end
}
```

#### input_selectors

The `input_selectors` property is an array of required claims and specifications on exactly how they will be evaluated.

```js
{
  "input_descriptors": [

  ]
}
```

In this first input descriptor, the Employer provides an `id` for this descriptor.

```js
{
  "input_descriptors": [
    {
      "id": "employmentHistoryVerification",
    }
  ]
}
```


The `name` and `purpose` should be human-readable as they may be shown to the user.

```js
{
  "input_descriptors": [
    {
      "id": "employmentHistoryVerification",
      //highlight-start
      "name": "Employment History",
      "purpose": "Verify the applicant's previous employment experiences",
      //highlight-end
    }
  ]
}
```

#### constraints
The `constraints` object contains the exact test that the VC will need to pass in order to meet the requirement.

```js
{
  "input_descriptors": [
    {
      "id": "employmentHistoryVerification",
      "name": "Employment History",
      "purpose": "Verify the applicant's previous employment experiences",
      //highlight-start
      "constraints": {

      }
      //highlight-end
    },
  ]
}
```

#### fields
Under `constraints` is an array of `fields` objects, each object representing a specific piece of data that the Employer is interested in. Each field can have its own constraints.

```js
{
  "input_descriptors": [
    {
      "id": "employmentHistoryVerification",
      "name": "Employment History",
      "purpose": "Verify the applicant's previous employment experiences",
      "constraints": {
        //highlight-start
        "fields": [

        ]
        //highlight-end
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

#### path
The `path` key specifies the location within the VC where the data is expected to be found.
Here, `$.type[*]` indicates that the Employer will verify the `type` attribute of the submitted VCs to see if any of its values match the `filter`.

```js
{
  "input_descriptors": [
    {
      "id": "employmentHistoryVerification",
      "name": "Employment History",
      "purpose": "Verify the applicant's previous employment experiences",
      "constraints": {
        "fields": [
          {
            //highlight-start
            "path": ["$.type[*]"],
            "filter": {

            }
            //highlight-end
          }
        ]
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

#### filter

The `filter` provides the specific conditions that the data in the specified path must satisfy.
Here, it's saying that the expected data `type` of the field is a string, and the `pattern` property indicates that the value should match the provided regular expression.

In this case, the Employer expects the applicant to submit a VC whose type includes the word "Employment".

```js
{
  "input_descriptors": [
    {
      "id": "employmentHistoryVerification",
      "name": "Employment History",
      "purpose": "Verify the applicant's previous employment experiences",
      "constraints": {
        "fields": [
          {
            "path": ["$.type[*]"],
            //highlight-start
            "filter": {
              "type": "string",
              "pattern": "Employment"
            }
            //highlight-end
          }
        ]
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

:::info
The `filter` property offers a lot of flexibility. Refer to the [Presentation Definition spec](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v1.0.0/#json-schema-2) for more examples.
:::


The next input descriptor describes that if a degree VC is provided, it must be a degree with one of the following terms in the title: Engineering, Computer, Cyber, or Security.

If someone has a degree in Biology, for example, that won't satisfy this requirement.

```js
    {
      "id": "degreeVerification",
      "name": "Degree",
      "purpose": "Confirm the applicant's academic qualification",
      "constraints": {
        "fields": [
          {
            //highlight-start
            "path": ["$.credentialSubject.degree.type"],
            "filter": {
              "type": "string",
              "pattern": "(Engineering|Computer|Cyber|Security)"
            }
            //highlight-end
          }
        ]
      }
    },
```

This Employer also requires a Ethical Hacking certification from a specific reputable institution.

For this credential, there's two fields that the Employer wants to add constraints for: the name of the certification, and the organization that issued the credential.

Notice the `filter` for the certification's name uses `pattern` so that it checks the name with a regular expression.
This gives flexibility in case the certification is for "Advanced Certified Ethical Hacker" or "Certified Ethical Hacker II", etc.

But the `filter` for the issuer uses `const` to indicate that the issuer's DID must match this value exactly.

```js
    {
      "id": "CEH_CertificationVerification",
      "name": "Certified Ethical Hacker Certification",
      "purpose": "Confirm the applicant holds a Certified Ethical Hacker certification",
      //highlight-start
      "constraints": {
        "fields": [
          {
            "path": ["$.credentialSubject.certifications[*].name"],
            "filter": {
              "type": "string",
              "pattern": "Certified Ethical Hacker"
            }
          },
          {
            "path": ["$.issuer"],
            "filter": {
              "type": "string",
              "const": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
      //highlight-end
    }
```

For the issuer, the Employer only accepts VCs from the top trusted source who issues these certifications, so they enter the organization's DID as a constraint.
If an applicant provides a Ethical Hacker Certification that was issued by anyone other than this organization, that VC will not meet the requirements.

```js
//highlight-start
    {
      "path": ["$.issuer"],
      "filter": {
        "type": "string",
        "const": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi"
      }
    }
//highlight-end
```

## Validate the Presentation Definition

Once the PD is created, you can validate it to ensure there are no errors in its design.

1. import classes needed for a Presentation Exchange

<Shnip
  inlineSnippets={[
    {
      code: `import { PresentationExchange } from '@web5/credentials';`,
      language: 'JavaScript',
    },
    {
      code: `
import web5.sdk.credentials.PresentationExchange
import web5.sdk.credentials.model.*
      `,
      language: 'Kotlin',
    }
  ]}
/>

2. call `validateDefinition()`
>This assumes the [presentation definition](/docs/web5/verifiable-credentials/presentation-definition#example-presentation-definition) is assigned to variable `pd`

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    { snippetName: 'validatePresentationDefinition', language: 'JavaScript' },
    { snippetName: 'validatePresentationDefinitionKt', language: 'Kotlin' },
    ]}
/>

If there are errors with the PD, an error will be thrown:

```
This is not a valid PresentationDefinition
```
