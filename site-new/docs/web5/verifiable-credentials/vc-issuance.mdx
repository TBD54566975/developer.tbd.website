# Issue a VC

This guide provides a step-by-step process for issuing a [Verifiable Credential (VC)](/docs/web5/verifiable-credentials/what-are-vcs), covering everything from installing the SDK to signing the credential.

<details>
<summary>Prerequisites</summary>

**Install Packages**

<Dependencies
  languageDependencies={[
    { language: "javascript", dependencies: ["@web5/credentials"] },
    { language: "maven", dependencies: ["web5-credentials"] },
    { language: "gradle", dependencies: ["web5-credentials"] },
  ]}
/>{" "}

**Install Classes**

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
  `import {VerifiableCredential} from "@web5/credentials";`
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock language="kotlin">
  `import xyz.block.web5.credentials.VerifiableCredential`
</CodeBlock>

**Obtain DIDs**

VCs are issued to and from subjects of [Decentralized Identifiers (DID)](/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/what-are-dids).

- If you don't already have one, you can [create a DID](/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did).
- Also, you'll need the DID of the entity you'll like to issue the VC to.

</details>

## VC Properties

Credentials are created in JSON format and contain the following properties:

- **type:** Type of the credential (e.g. EmploymentCredential, EducationCredential)
- **issuer:** DID of the entity who is issuing the credential
- **subject:** DID of the entity that the credential is being issued to
- **expirationDate:** (optional) The date when the credential expires (in ISO 8601 standard format)
- **data:** JSON containing claims that are being asserted

## Create VC

To create the VC, utilize the `VerifiableCredential.create()` method. Pass a JSON object containing the properties as shown below:

<Shnip
  snippetName="createEmploymentCredential"
  languages={["JavaScript", "Kotlin"]}
/>

This results in:

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
  {`
{
  "vcDataModel": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"
    ],
    "type": [
      "VerifiableCredential",
      "EmploymentCredential"
    ],
    "id": "urn:uuid:84953246-a77f-4c5a-a336-69a55bd92989",
    "issuer": "did:dht:fhzeks5bkferfztk6m63xjkg7a4hbf7snk444g8f1h1xapt391ty",

      "employmentStatus": "Contractor"
    },
    "expirationDate": "2023-09-30T12:34:56Z"
  }
}
`}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock language="kotlin">
  {`
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"
  ],
  "type": [
    "VerifiableCredential",
    "EmploymentCredential"
  ],
  "id": "urn:uuid:84953246-a77f-4c5a-a336-69a55bd92989",
  "issuer": "did:dht:fhzeks5bkferfztk6m63xjkg7a4hbf7snk444g8f1h1xapt391ty",
  "issuanceDate": "2023-03-31T06:08:49Z",
  "expirationDate":"2023-09-30T12:34:56Z",
  "credentialSubject": {

    "startDate": "2023-04-01T12:34:56Z",
    "employmentStatus": "Contractor"
  }
}
`}
</CodeBlock>

## Sign VC

The next step is signing the VC. This cryptographic process, performed by the issuer, ensures the integrity and authenticity of the VC:

<Shnip
  snippetName="signEmploymentCredential"
  languages={["JavaScript", "Kotlin"]}
/>

Signing the credential returns a [VC JWT](/docs/web5/verifiable-credentials/jwt-to-vc#what-is-a-jwt):

```
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsI...
```

Giving this VC JWT to the holder completes the issuance of the credential.

VC JWTs can be [converted back](/docs/web5/verifiable-credentials/jwt-to-vc#decoding-jwt) to a JSON object by applications that need to engage with the contents of the credential.
