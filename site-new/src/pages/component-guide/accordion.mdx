## AccordionItem Component

<div className="component-guide text-white">
<p>The AccordionItem component is used to create collapsible sections, typically for FAQs or hidden content that users can expand to reveal more details. The component allows setting a summary and details, with customization options for tone and disabled states. This component is used within an `AccordionToneProvider` for consistent tone styling and an `AccordionRoot` to manage state and behavior.</p>
