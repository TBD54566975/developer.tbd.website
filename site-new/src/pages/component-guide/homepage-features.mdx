# HomepageFeatures Component

| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `title`       | `string`                                           | Yes      | Title of the feature.                     |

## Usage

```jsx title="HomepageFeatures Component"
<HomepageFeatures />
```

## Examples

### Basic Example

This example renders the `HomepageFeatures` component with three sample feature items.

```jsx
<HomepageFeatures />
```

## Feature Item Example

Each feature item can be customized with a different SVG and text content. Here is an example of a feature item structure:

```jsx
{
  title: 'Easy to Use',
  Svg: require('@site/static/img/undraw_docusaurus_mountain.svg').default,
  description: (
    <>
      Docusaurus was designed from the ground up to be easily installed and
      used to get your website up and running quickly.
    </>
  ),
}
```

## Customizing the Feature Component

To create a custom feature, you can modify the properties in the `FeatureList` array. Each feature item renders as a column with a title, icon, and description.

### Adding a New Feature Item

Add a new item to the `FeatureList` array to display an additional feature.

```jsx
const FeatureList: FeatureItem[] = [
  ...FeatureList,
  {
    title: 'Custom Feature',
    Svg: require('@site/static/img/custom_icon.svg').default,
    description: (
      <>
        Customize your feature list by adding new items to the array.
      </>
    ),
  },
];
```

</div>
