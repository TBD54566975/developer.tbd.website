# did
## Overview
The `did` class is responsible for providing operations related to DIDs

<Divider type="slash"/>

<section class="api-docs">

## Methods

<br/>

### create(method, options)

Enables generation of DIDs for a [supported set of DID Methods](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers#methods). The output is method-specific, and handles things like key generation and assembly of DID Documents that can be published to DID networks.

:::note
You do not usually need to manually invoke this, as the <a href="/api/web5-js/#connect">Web5.connect()</a> method already acquires a DID for the user (either by direct creation or connection to an identity agent app).

#### Parameters

<ApiDetails
  details={[
    {
      data: {
        type: 'string',
        field: 'method',
        value: 'The method on which to create the did. Supported methods are: \'ion\' and \'key\'',
      },
    },
    {
      data: {
        type: 'CreateOptions',
        field: 'options',
        value: 'Enables customization of the DID formation based on the DID method',
        isOptional: true,
      },
    },
  ]}
/>


#### Return Value

The created DID

#### Code Example

<CodeSnippet function="createMyDid" />

```js
const myDid = await web5.did.create('ion');
```

<Divider type="slash"/>

### resolve(did)

Resolves a DID into a DID document by using the "read" operation of the applicable DID method. DIDs that are resolved are cached for a default of 15 minutes.

#### Parameters

<ApiDetails
  details={[
    {
      data: {
        type: 'string',
        field: 'did',
        value: 'The decentralized identifier to resolve',
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Return Value

<ApiDetails
  details={[
    {
      data: {
        type: 'DidResolutionResult',
        field: 'result',
        value: 'DID resolution result which includes DID Document and its metadata',
      },
    },
  ]}
/>


#### Code Example

```js
const myDid = 'did:key:z6MkhvthBZDxVvLUswRey729CquxMiaoYXrT5SYbCAATc8V9';
const didDocument = await web5.did.resolve(myDid);
```
