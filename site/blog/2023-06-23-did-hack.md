## did:hack Hackathon

The Decentralized Identity Foundation organized [did:hack](https://didhack.xyz/), a decentralized identity hackathon designed for people to learn, collaborate, and think creatively about how decentralized identity technology can be leveraged to improve digital interactions in the future.

The 4-day virtual event included sessions from TBD, SpruceID, Dock.io, Aviary Tech, Trinsic, and Danube Tech - all providing educational sessions on ecosystem tools that enable decentralized identity and verifiable credentials.

## Hackathon Projects

Hackathon participants gathered in small teams to build projects centered around decentralized identity. There were some amazing ideas including:

- `did:loc`, a privacy preserving location sharing DID method
- a decentralized personal finance app using [Web5](/docs)
- a mobile voting app that allows people to cast a vote from a mobile phone, and verifies a voter's eligibility with a verifiable credential that belongs to a DID
- a browser extension to display and verify DID and Verifiable Presentation data for the currently viewed website
- `did-bsv`, a DID method for verifiable ordinals
- a decentralized housing platform using DIDs and VCs for reputation tracking

Fortunately, the [presentations of the projects](https://youtu.be/0o9PJ1HmNuQ) were recorded.

## Hackathon Winner

D-PFin, a team comprised of [Moises Jaramillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moisesjaramillo/), [Courtney Chan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chanyongxue/) and [Dixita Sharegar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharegardixita/), used Web5 to create a decentralized personal finance app that stored financial data in a [DWN](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes) and provides information to the user to make financial decisions.

We're delighted that the D-PFin team chose Web5 to build their decentralized app! It's a testament of the power of coupling decentralized personal data stores with decentralized identity. Be sure to watch the team's final presentation below.
