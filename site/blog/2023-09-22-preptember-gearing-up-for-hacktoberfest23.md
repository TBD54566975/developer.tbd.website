## 🎤 From a First-time Contributor

I remember my first-time contribution jitters. Every step felt like a monumental task, and the fear of making a mistake? Oh boy! Here’s a snippet from my Twitter thread on my first contribution experience:

> "... I made all of the changes locally, and then opened a PR. Looked over it a zillion times, because, you know, it's in the public's eye! Yikes! And despite all the caution, I still goofed up my first PR. 🤦🏾‍♀️ But guess what? The community stepped in, guided me, and boom! PR merged. It was .."

You can check out my complete thread and the roller-coaster of emotions I went through [here](https://twitter.com/EbonyJLouis/status/1445864374762020866). If I could do it, trust me so can you!

> **Hot Tip**: Pair up with someone from our [`hack-together`](https://discord.com/channels/937858703112155166/1151519449837482044) channel on Discord. Two heads (or more) are always better than one.
