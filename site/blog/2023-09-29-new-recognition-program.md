Today we unveil something special - our very own Recognition Program! ✨

<!--truncate-->

## 💭 What's this all about?

This program is our way of expressing our deepest gratitude to each and every one of you. We know that our community thrives because of your dedication and contributions, and it's high time we recognize your amazing efforts.


## 🏆 The Categories

We've carefully crafted six categories to celebrate different aspects of our community:



* Feedback Champion Award 📣: This category honors the individuals who provide invaluable feedback, helping us improve and grow.
* Content Creator Award 🎥: Recognizing the creative minds who share their knowledge through content creation, whether it's articles, videos, or other forms of media.
* Community Hero Award 🦸: For those who go above and beyond to support and uplift fellow community members.
* Rising Star Award 🌟: Celebrating the newcomers who have made a significant impact in a short amount of time.
* New Contributor Award 🆕: Acknowledging those who have recently joined us and made their first contributions.
* Docs Wizard Award 📖: Highlighting the experts who excel in documentation, making our resources more accessible and helpful.


## 🎁 The Rewards

Each category winner will receive gift cards to our [TBD swag shop](https://www.tbd.shop/), where they can choose up to 2 items of their liking. It's our small way of saying THANK YOU for your outstanding contributions.

Not only that, the winners will also be prominently featured on our website's community landing page for everyone to see and celebrate their achievements! 🌟


## 🗓 Announcement Schedule

For September, to kick us off, winners in each category will be announced on Monday 10/2nd. Each category will have one winner.

Starting from October, there may be more than one winner in each category, and the category names can change upon community request.

You can nominate winners for each category during our monthly dedicated Discord thread, held on the second-to-last Friday of every month. Mark your calendars for October's nominations on 10/20th in our [#general channel!](https://discord.gg/tbd) 🗓️👥


## 🤗 Community Involvement

Our community is at the heart of everything we do, and we value your input. This Recognition Program is a collaborative effort, and you have a say in how it evolves. Categories can change based on community feedback, and we encourage you to actively participate in shaping this program.

This is just the beginning, and we can't wait to kick off this journey with you all. Together, let's make our community even more vibrant and supportive than ever before.

Let the Recognition Program commence! 🥳 #RecognitionProgram #CommunityAppreciation

Stay tuned! Who do you think our September recognition winners are going to be? 🤔
