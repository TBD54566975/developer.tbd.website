![tbDEX 1.0 Now Available](/img/tbdex-v1-blog-header.png)

The first major version of [tbDEX](https://www.tbdex.io/), an open source liquidity and trust protocol, has been released! üéâ SDK implementations of the protocol are available in TypeScript/JavaScript, Kotlin, and Swift enabling integration with Web, Android, and iOS applications.

<!--truncate-->

tbDEX enables wallet applications to connect liquidity seekers with providers and equips all participants with a common language for facilitating transactions.

tbDEX is architected on [Web5](/projects/web5/) infrastructure, utilizing decentralized technologies such as [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers) and [Verifiable Credentials (VCs)](/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials) to securely validate counterparty identity and trust, as well as helping to enable compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

## üè¶ Features for PFIs
Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) can use tbDEX to provide liquidity to any wallet application in the world who also uses tbDEX. Version 1.0 of tbDEX includes the ability to:

* Provide a static list of offered currency pairs and payment methods

* Specify the required credentials the customer must provide in order to transact

* Provide real-time quotes based on the financial transaction the customer is requesting as well as the payment methods selected

* Provide status updates on orders

* Indicate if the transaction was completed successfully or not


## üíº Features for Wallets

Wallet applications using tbDEX act as agents for customers who are seeking liquidity. Version 1.0 of tbDEX includes the ability to:

* Obtain service offerings from PFIs to determine which meet your customers' needs

* Initiate exchanges with PFIs

* Present verifiable credentials to PFIs on behalf of your customers

* Receive real-time quotes and place orders

* Receive status updates on orders

* Cancel an exchange


## ‚úÖ Features for Issuers
In a tbDEX ecosystem, verifiable credentials - created and distributed by Issuers - serve as a method for establishing trust and facilitating regulatory compliance during transactions. tbDEX utilizes the Web5 SDK to allow Issuers to:

* Create decentralized identifiers for PFIs, Issuers, and Wallet users

* Issue verifiable credentials

* Verify credentials


:::tip KYC Credential
We have developed a [Known Customer Credential](https://www.tbdex.io/guides/kcc) specifically designed to represent a PFI's Know Your Customer regulatory requirements.
