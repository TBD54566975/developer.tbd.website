TBD took to Accra and Nairobi for the month of May taking developers on a hands-on workshop to learn how to build payment applications with tbDEX - the language of global payments.

<!--truncate-->


Following the successful [launch of tbDEX 1.0](https://www.tbd.website/blog/tbd-launches-tbdex-in-latam) at Web Summit Rio, the TBD team took to the road to empower hundreds of developers in Accra and Nairobi - hosting full day workshops to teach developers how to use tbDEX, an open source liquidity and trust protocol, to unlock frictionless, compliant cross-border payments.

tbDEX enables seamless exchanges across a diverse range of currency pairings - a solution that was very well received by the developers in attendance. There was a lot of enthusiasm, curiousity and excitement as the developers were taken through the process of building a simple wallet application that uses the tbDEX SDK to connect with a sandbox of financial institutions.

The tbDEX roadshow workshops in Ghana and Kenya were such a delightful success. A packed house of developers in both Accra and Ghana left feeling very empowered as they shared on social media posts - across [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7199777112713486337?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7199777112713486337%29), and [Twitter](https://x.com/yellowcard_app/status/1795385010117386749).
