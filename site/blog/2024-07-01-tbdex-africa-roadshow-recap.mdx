Following the successful [launch of tbDEX 1.0](/blog/tbdex-v1) in Rio de Janeiro, TBD embarked on a roadshow across Africa, visiting Accra, Nairobi, and Cape Town. 
Our mission was to engage with local developers and share tbDEX, an open source protocol for global payments.

Recognizing that many African countries face significant barriers to participating in the global economy, we aimed to support the vibrant and growing developer communities in these regions. 
These communities are already tackling these challenges head-on, and we wanted to contribute by providing open source tools to build robust payment applications.

The roadshow featured full-day, hands-on workshops in Accra and Nairobi, where hundreds of developers gathered to learn how to utilize tbDEX. 
The excitement was palpable as participants built wallet applications using the tbDEX SDK. 
The enthusiasm and curiosity among the developers were evident, and the success of these workshops was widely shared across [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7199777112713486337/?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7199777112713486337%29) and [Twitter](https://x.com/yellowcard_app/status/1795385010117386749).

Angie Jones, Head of Developer Relations, and Adewale Abati, Staff Developer Advocate, led the workshops, demonstrating the capabilities of developers eager to integrate advanced payment solutions. 
Co-sponsored by Yellow Card and Circle, these sessions saw developers integrating wallet applications with tbDEX in just one day.

In addition to the workshops, TBD actively participated in notable conferences across Africa. 
At the 3iAfrica conference in Accra, Mike Brock, CEO of TBD, delivered an insightful session titled "Trust Reimagined in the Digital Assets World," discussing the economic principles behind digital assets and their impact on trust and value exchange in business. 
Angie Jones hosted a roundtable discussion on tbDEX as an open protocol for global money movement."

The team also made a stop at Joy 99.7 FM radio station in Ghana, where Mike and Angie discussed how digital identity can enhance payment systems.

The journey continued to the ID4Africa conference in Cape Town, where TBD engaged with local stakeholders to gain deeper insights into the challenges surrounding digital identity.

Overall, the roadshow was a significant step in connecting with developer communities across Africa. 
We were inspired by the talent and determination we encountered and look forward to seeing the innovative solutions that will emerge from these collaborations.
