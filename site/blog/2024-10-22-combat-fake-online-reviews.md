The [Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) has introduced a new rule banning fake online reviews](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ftcs-rule-banning-fake-online-reviews-effect-115009298). This rule, which penalizes businesses and individuals involved in the sale or purchase of fake reviews, represents a much needed step in promoting trust online. But while enforcement is crucial, there's still a challenge of identifying which reviews are legitimate. This is where [Verifiable Credentials (VCs)](/docs/web5/verifiable-credentials/what-are-vcs) can provide a solution.

## The Problem with Fake Reviews
Fake reviews have been an issue for years, distorting consumer choices. As FTC Chair Lina Khan pointed out, these reviews “pollute the marketplace and divert business away from honest competitors.” 

Let's face it, with pretty much every social networking site turning into an online shopping mall, many purchasing decisions are influenced by online reviews. I, personally, do most of my shopping online and I rely very heavily on reviews. I often question which ones are actually real, and if I'm not sure, I often shy away from making the purchase at all - which isn't good for me or the business.

The new FTC rule aims to crack down on this problem by prohibiting reviews from people who don’t exist, those who have no real experience with the product, or those misrepresenting their experience. It also bans businesses from creating or selling fake reviews. While these measures are great, enforcing them effectively presents challenges, especially with AI-generated content.

## How Can Verifiable Credentials Help
Verifiable Credentials are digital certificates that prove specific facts about an individual or entity. These credentials are cryptographically signed, making them tamper-proof, and they can be independently verified without relying on a central authority. In the context of online reviews, VCs can establish authenticity.

Here’s how it could work:

When a customer purchases a product or uses a service, the business can issue a VC to confirm their legitimate experience. This can even be attached to their receipt. This credential could serve as proof that the individual has transacted with the business, preventing fake reviews from people with no real experience.

A review platform could require users to attach a VC that verifies they have purchased or used the product before submitting a review. This would eliminate fake reviews from non-customers and ensure that only those with firsthand experience can provide feedback.

Since VCs are cryptographically signed, they cannot be altered or faked. This ensures the integrity of the review content and prevents businesses from modifying or fabricating reviews to boost their reputations.

## Benefits for Businesses and Consumers

* Consumers would no longer have to second guess the authenticity of reviews. They can trust that every review is tied to a verified, real customer.

* By adopting VCs, businesses can ensure they remain compliant with the new FTC rule. They would have a verifiable record that shows they only accept reviews from legitimate customers, protecting themselves from potential penalties.

* Early adopters of VCs in their review systems could set themselves apart from competitors. Businesses that champion transparency and fairness by using VCs can build stronger relationships with their customers, enhancing brand loyalty.

* Using VCs can automate the verification process, reducing the need for manual review moderation. As AI continues to be used in generating content, including reviews, this automation is key to keeping platforms efficient while maintaining high standards of trust.

## Trust But Verify

The FTC’s new rule is a step in the right direction, but to truly tackle the problem of fake reviews, the marketplace needs more than just enforcement. It needs technology that ensures transparency and trust. Verifiable Credentials can provide that assurance, giving businesses and consumers the tools they need to foster a fair, competitive, and honest marketplace. As online commerce continues to grow, adopting VCs could be the key to making reviews a trustworthy resource once again.
