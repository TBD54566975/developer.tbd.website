# How Decentralized Apps Can Make Everyday Tasks Easy

Whenever I explore technology that's new to me, whether it be learning how decentralized apps work or what an open source tool does, it's seeing the technology in action that helps me understand whether or not it can impact me and my every day life. This is why every month at TBD, what better way to learn about our technology in action than from innovators using TBD's technologies today.

As our open source projects continue to develop, our community members contribute to the global effort of decentralizing the web with their independent projects. Here are the latest contributions from them.

## Ariton

Developed by Sondre Bjellås (@sondreb), Ariton is a Web5 community SuperApp, a decentralized platform for building and managing communities! Ariton runs on any device with the ability to add any Mini Apps (or features) you want, like chat, groups, events, notes and more. Built on free and open standards, your identity and data is always in your full control. Currently in prototype stage, you can learn more and [try it out here](https://ariton.app/#learn).

## Kin AI

Kin AI is a personalized Web5 AI companion that offers guidance, coaching, and emotional support! Kin helps you piece together your problems and how to solve them in a way that seamlessly fits how you want it to. All your data stays on your device, and no one can access it without your specific permission. Live in beta, you can [get early access on the App or Play store](https://mykin.ai/#your-life-with-kin).

## BlockCore Wallet

Also developed by Sondre (mentioned above), BlockCore Wallet is a non-custodial Web5 wallet in your browser that supports DIDs (decentralized identifiers), tokens, crypto currencies and more! You can add different accounts, send/receive payments, and even use an address book to quickly send multiple payments to one contact. You can learn more and try it out yourself in the [BlockCore Wallet Guide](https://www.blockcore.net/wallet/guide).
