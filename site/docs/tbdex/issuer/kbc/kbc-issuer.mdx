# Issuing a Known Business Credential

Known Business Credentials (KBC) are [Verifiable Credentials](/docs/web5/verifiable-credentials/what-are-vcs) designed to streamline the Know Your Business (KYB) process for tbDEX protocol users. 
By issuing this credential, the PFI attests to the businessâ€™s legitimacy and compliance with regulations, allowing the PFI to engage in financial activities with the Wallet application without requiring individual KYC for each customer.


:::danger Important
This guide is intended for educational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Compliance programs may have varying requirements. Consult your legal and/or compliance advisors to ensure that the KBC is consistent with your legal and compliance obligations.

In this guide, we'll cover how to:
- Design and issue a KBC
- Specify a KBC as a required claim in an [Offering](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/tbdex/pfi/creating-offerings)

## Design Known Business Credential
When creating a Verifiable Credential, you can design a model class to represent the specific type of credential you'd like to issue.
When defining a KbcCredential, you'll need to specify an `id` and a `credentialSchema`.
