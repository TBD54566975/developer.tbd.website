# Issuing a Known Business Credential

Known Business Credentials (KBC) are [Verifiable Credentials](/docs/web5/verifiable-credentials/what-are-vcs) designed to streamline the Know Your Business (KYB) process for tbDEX protocol users. 

By issuing this credential, the PFI attests to the business’s legitimacy and compliance with regulations, allowing the PFI to engage in financial activities with the Wallet application without requiring individual KYC for each customer.


:::danger Important
This guide is intended for educational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Compliance programs may have varying requirements. Consult your legal and/or compliance advisors to ensure that the KBC is consistent with your legal and compliance obligations.
:::

In this guide, we'll cover how to:
- Design and issue a KBC
- Specify a KBC as a required claim in an [Offering](/docs/tbdex/pfi/creating-offerings)

## Environment Setup

If you haven't already, please follow the [Credential Issuance Server Setup Guide](/docs/tbdex/issuer/vc-serverSetup) for detailed instructions on the dependencies and packages needed to set up your server

## Issue Credential

To issue a KBC, call `VerifiableCredential.create()` and pass in the URL to the credential schema the VC is based on. 

We've designed an open source schema for KBCs that you're welcome to use at https://vc.schemas.host/kbc.schema.json.

      snippetName: 'issueKbcKt',
      language: 'Kotlin',
    }
  ]}

## Specify KBC as Requirement

If you issue a KBC to a business, you'll want to specify that credential as a [required claim](/docs/tbdex/pfi/creating-offerings#required-claims) on any applicable Offerings you may provide. 

:::note
The `id` property is a string that uniquely identifies the `input_descriptor`. It is required and must be unique within the `presentation_definition`.
