# Requesting a Known Customer Credential

Known Customer Credentials (KCCs) are [Verifiable Credentials](/docs/web5/verifiable-credentials/what-are-vcs) designed to streamline the [Know Your Customer (KYC)](https://www.tbdex.io/guides/compliance) process for tbDEX protocol users. KCCs help in gaining access to PFIs that provide regulated financial services.

For a comprehensive exploration of the practical applications and compliance considerations of KCCs, refer to the [KCC Compliance Guide](https://www.tbdex.io/guides/kcc). It provides detailed examples and insights into how KCCs align with certain regulatory requirements. This offers valuable context for those overseeing the implementation and management of KCCs.

In this guide, we'll cover:

- **Identity Verification (IDV)**: How your Wallet App initiates and supports the IDV process conformant with [Self Issued OpenID Provider V2 (SIOPv2)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html) and [OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OID4VP)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html), ensuring users can securely verify their identity.
- **Credential Request**: The steps needed for your Wallet App to request a KCC on a user's behalf after successful IDV.
- **Credential Management**: How the Wallet utilizes existing credentials for KCC requests and securely stores the KCC itself.

## Environment Setup

### Install Dependencies

Your Wallet App will require libraries for handling HTTP requests and processing [JSON Web Tokens(JWTs)](https://jwt.io/). You can include these libraries in your project by installing the following dependencies:

<Dependencies languageDependencies={[
  { language: 'javascript', dependencies: ['@web5/credentials', '@web5/dids', 'node-fetch'] },
  { language: 'maven', dependencies: ['web5-credentials', 'web5-dids',  'io.ktor:ktor-client-cio:2.3.9', 'io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.3.9', 'com.nimbusds:nimbus-jose-jwt:9.15.2'] },
  { language: 'gradle', dependencies: ['web5-credentials', 'web5-dids',  'io.ktor:ktor-client-cio:2.3.9', 'io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.3.9'] },
  { language: 'swift', dependencies: ['Web5'] }
]}/>

## IDV Process

Identity Verification is a critical component of typical KYC requirements, where certain types of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) are collected and verified from an individual. IDV is a crucial step before a KCC can be issued.

The IDV flow begins when your app, as the customer's agent, sends an HTTP request to the Issuer's IDV service endpoint specified in the Issuer's [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/what-are-dids) Document.

### 1. Get IDV Endpoint

Resolve the Issuer's DID to get the IDV service Endpoint that can be found in the Issuer's [DID Document](/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/what-are-dids#did-documents):

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialResolveIssuerDidJS',
      language: 'JavaScript',
      title: 'wallet.js',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialResolveIssuerDidKT',
      language: 'Kotlin',
      title: 'Application.kt',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialResolveIssuerDidSwift',
      language: 'Swift',
      title: 'Application.swift',
    },
  ]}
/>

### 2. Send HTTP request to Service Endpoint

Send an HTTP request to the IDV Service Endpoint:

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialSendRequestToIdvServiceEndpointJS',
      language: 'JavaScript',
      title: 'wallet.js',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialSendRequestToIdvServiceEndpointKT',
      language: 'Kotlin',
      title: 'Application.kt',
    },
    {
      snippetName:
        'knownCustomerCredentialSendRequestToIdvServiceEndpointSwift',
      language: 'Swift',
      title: 'Application.swift',
    },
  ]}
/>

The Issuer will then respond with a [SIOPv2 Authorization Request](https://openid.github.io/SIOPv2/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-wg-draft.html#section-) in the [JWT-Secured Authorization Request (JAR)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9101.html) format.
This request contains information about the Issuer along with a [Presentation Definition](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/verifiable-credentials/presentation-definition). Some of the key information included is:

- **`client_id`**: Issuer's DID, establishing the Issuer/requestor's identity.
- **`response_type`**: Indicates the desired format (e.g., `id_token`, `vp_token`) where `id_token` is required and `vp_token` is optional. If the desired format specifies `vp_token`, a verifiable presentation token should be provided to satisfy the presentation definition contained within the request.
- **`response_uri`**: Indicates the callback url for the Wallet, ensuring direct communication between the Wallet and the Issuer.
- **`nonce`**: A unique identifier tying together the request and its response.

Here's a JSON example where `id_token` and `vp_token` are both requested:

              purpose: 'Your national identifier.',
            },
          ],
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

</details>

:::info

- `id_token` is a self-issued Identity Token that authenticates the customer to the Issuer by sharing the customer's Decentralized Identifier.
- `vp_token` is a Verifiable Presentation that contains certified and authenticated claims about the customer.

In this guide, we'll cover an example `vp_token` and `id_token`.

To learn more refer to OpenID's specs on [Issued Identity Token](https://openid.github.io/SIOPv2/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-wg-draft.html#name-self-issued-id-token) and [Verifiable Presentation Token](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html#section-6.1-2.2).
:::

### 3. Create SIOPv2 Authorization Response

Decode the Issuer's SIOPv2 Authorization Request and create a [SIOPv2 Authorization Response](https://openid.github.io/SIOPv2/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-wg-draft.html#section-10) with `id_token` and `vp_token`:

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialhandleSiopRequestWalletJS',
      language: 'JavaScript',
      title: 'wallet.js',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialhandleSiopRequestWalletKT',
      language: 'Kotlin',
      title: 'Application.kt',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialhandleSiopRequestWalletSwift',
      language: 'Swift',
      title: 'Application.swift',
    },
  ]}
/>

:::info
If the User's Verifiable Credentials do not satisfy the Authorization Request's Presentation Definition then only the `id_token` will be sent to the Issuer's `response_uri`. If the credentials **do** satisfy then a [Verifiable Presentation](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/glossary/#verifiable-presentation) (`vp_token`) will also be sent.  
:::

If `vp_token` wasn't in the SIOPv2 Response, the Issuer will respond with a `credential_offer` and a `url` that points to a webpage (IDV form) for the customer to provide their Personally Identifiable Information. After successful completion of this form, the Wallet can proceed with the next steps, [processing the Credential Offer](#processing-the-credential-offer).

![IDV Form](/img/pii-form.gif)

> IDV Form being filled out

## Processing the Credential Offer

After successful completion of the Identity Verification - whether via form or the necessary VCs - your Wallet application will then begin processing the `credential_offer` from the Issuer. Here's an example of a `credential_offer`:

```javascript
// Issuer.js

{
  "credential_issuer": "https://issuer.example.com",
  "credential_configuration_ids": [
    "knownCustomerCredential-basic",
    "knownCustomerCredential-extended"
  ],
  "grants": {
    "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:pre-authorized_code": "abc123xyz"
  }
}
```

The `credential_offer` object contains vital information about the Issuer:

- **`credential_issuer`**: The base URL address of the Issuer's service. It is used by the Wallet to retrieve the Issuer's Metadata and the Issuer's Authorization Server Metadata.
- **`credential_configuration_ids`**: Unique strings that identify the credential you are offering. The Wallet can use these to request metadata.
- **`grants`**: Contains grant types the Issuer will accept for this credential offer.
- **`urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:pre-authorized_code`**: Grant type required for the [OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#appendix-B.1) Pre-Authorization flow.
- **`pre-authorized_code`**: The code representing the Credential Issuer's authorization for the Wallet to obtain an access token.

### 1. Extract Credential Offer

Extract and store the `credential_issuer` URL and `pre_authorized_code` from the credential offer:

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialHandleIssuerResponseWalletJS',
      language: 'JavaScript',
      title: 'wallet.js',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialHandleIssuerResponseWalletKT',
      language: 'Kotlin',
      title: 'Application.kt',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialHandleIssuerResponseWalletSwift',
      language: 'Swift',
      title: 'Application.swift',
    },
  ]}
/>

:::info
The `credential_issuer` URL is crucial for the next steps, as it will be used to construct the URLs for fetching the Issuer's Metadata and the Issuer's Authorization Server Metadata.
:::

### 2. Get Issuer's Metadata

Fetch the Issuer's Metadata from the `credential_issuers` URL

To construct the URL to fetch the Issuer's Metadata, the Wallet needs to append `/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer` to the `credential_issuer` URL provided in the `credential_offer`:

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialFetchIssuerMetadataWalletJS',
      language: 'JavaScript',
      title: 'wallet.js',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialFetchIssuerMetadataWalletKT',
      language: 'Kotlin',
      title: 'Application.kt',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialFetchIssuerMetadataWalletSwift',
      language: 'Swift',
      title: 'Application.swift',
    },
  ]}
/>

The Issuer's Metadata includes information about the Issuer's capabilities, credential endpoint, supported credential configurations, and more. Some of the key information included is:

- `credential_issuer`: The base URL address of the Issuer's service. It is used by the Wallet to retrieve the Issuer's Metadata and the Issuer's Authorization Server Metadata.
- `credential_endpoint`: The endpoint the Wallet will use to submit requests to issue credentials. After obtaining an access token, the Wallet sends a credential request to this endpoint.
- `credential_configurations_supported`: Defines the format `jwt_vc_json`, and the credential, including informative display markup.

Here is an example of an Issuer's Metadata:

<details close>
<summary>Issuer's Metadata</summary>

```javascript
// Issuer.js

{
  "credential_issuer": "https://issuer.example.com",
  "credential_endpoint": "https://issuer.example.com/credentials",
  "credential_configurations_supported": {
    "KnownCustomerCredential": {
      "format": "jwt_vc_json",
      "scope": "CustomerIdentity",
      "cryptographic_binding_methods_supported": ["did:example"],
      "credential_signing_alg_values_supported": ["EdDSA", "ES256K"],
      "credential_definition": {
        "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "KnownCustomerCredential"],
        "credentialSubject": {
          "country": {
            "display": [
              {
                "name": "Country",
                "locale": "en-US"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      },
      "proof_types_supported": {
        "jwt": {
          "proof_signing_alg_values_supported": ["EdDSA", "ES256K"]
        }
      },
      "display": [
        {
          "name": "Known Customer Credential",
          "locale": "en-US",
          "logo": {
            "url": "https://issuer.example.com/public/logo.png",
            "alt_text": "Issuer Logo"
          },
          "background_color": "#FFFFFF",
          "text_color": "#000000"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

```

</details>

### 3. Get Authorization Server's Metadata

Fetch the Authorization Server's Metadata

Before the Wallet can request a KCC from the Issuer, the Wallet needs to also fetch the Issuer's Authorization Server Metadata by appending `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` to the `credential_issuer` URL in `handleIssuerResponse()`:

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialFetchAuthServerMetadataWalletJS',
      language: 'JavaScript',
      title: 'wallet.js',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialFetchAuthServerMetadataWalletKT',
      language: 'Kotlin',
      title: 'Application.kt',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialFetchAuthServerMetadataWalletSwift',
      language: 'Swift',
      title: 'Application.Swift',
    },
  ]}
/>

The Server Authorization Metadata can look like this:

<details open>
<summary>Server Authorization Metadata</summary>

```javascript
// Issuer.js

{
   "issuer": "https://issuer.example.com", // URL of the Credential Issuer
   "token_endpoint": "https://issuer.example.com/token", // URL for the Access Token Request
};
```

</details>

- `issuer`: The base URL of the Issuer's service.
- `token_endpoint`: The endpoint where the Wallet can exchange the `pre_authorization_code` receieved in the `credential_offer` for an access token.

### 4. Get Access Token

Fetch the Access Token from the Issuer's `/token` endpoint:

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialFetchAccessTokenWalletJS',
      language: 'JavaScript',
      title: 'wallet.js',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialFetchAccessTokenWalletKT',
      language: 'Kotlin',
      title: 'Application.kt',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialFetchAccessTokenWalletSwift',
      language: 'Swift',
      title: 'Application.swift',
    },
  ]}
/>

:::info
If the IDV process is incomplete, the Issuer will return an `authorization_pending` error. In this case, the Wallet should wait for a short period before attempting another request to the Issuer's `/token` endpoint. This will allow time for the IDV process to be completed. The Wallet should continue these periodic attempts until an `access_token` is successfully received, indicating that the IDV process has concluded and authorization has been granted.
:::

Here's an example Access Token Response from the Issuer:

<details open>
<summary>Access Token Response</summary>
```javascript
// Issuer.js

{
"access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJkaWQ6ZXhhbXBsZTpPcTJ4T0J4NVVjIiwiaXNzIjoiZGlkOmV4YW1wbGU6SXNzdWVyRGlkIiwiaWF0IjoxNjE1MjM5MDIyLCJleHAiOjE2MTUzMjU0MjIsImNfbm9uY2UiOiJzYW1wbGVjbm9uY2UifQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c",
"token_type": "bearer",
"expires_in": 86400,
"c_nonce": "adQssw5c",
"c_nonce_expires_in": 86400
}

````
</details>

## Request Known Customer Credential

After receiving the `access_token` from the Issuer, the Wallet can now send a KCC request to the `credential_endpoint` that was in the Issuer's Metadata.

### Send Request to Issuer's Credential Endpoint

Sign and Send an HTTP POST request to the Issuer's credential endpoint:

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialRequestCredentialWalletJS',
      language: 'JavaScript',

      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialRequestCredentialWalletKT',
      language: 'Kotlin',
      title: 'Application.kt',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'knownCustomerCredentialRequestCredentialWalletSwift',
      language: 'Swift',
      title: 'Application.swift',
    },
  ]}
/>

:::info
To learn more about the **fields** within the `payload` and `header`, please refer to [OpenID's specs](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#section-7.2.1.1-2.1.1).

The Known Customer Credential will be a signed VC [JSON Web Token](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json-web-token) for secure transmission.
:::

## Example Known Customer Credential

To convert the signed VC JWT into a `VerifiableCredential` object you can use the [`parseJwt()` method](/docs/web5/verifiable-credentials/jwt-to-vc#decoding-jwt). Here is what a decoded **Known Customer Credential** would look like:

To the user, an example KCC may look like this:

![example KCC](/img/aliceKcc.png)

With that, you've successfully gone through the Identity Verification flow, requested a Known Customer Credential on behalf of the user, and securely stored the user's Known Customer Credential. Please note that this example is a foundational implementation. For a production environment, it's crucial to enhance this basic setup with comprehensive error handling, secure storage and security measures.

## Next Steps 

For an example of the complete flow for requesting and issuing a KCC, check out the [Known Customer Credential Exemplar](https://github.com/TBD54566975/kcc-prototype-exemplar) on GitHub. This exemplar provides a implementation of requesting and issuing a Known Customer Credential (KCC).
