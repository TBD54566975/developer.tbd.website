# Credential Issuance

This guide introduces how to issue [verifiable credentials (VC)](/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials), a process for establishing trust between [Wallets](/docs/tbdex/wallet/overview) and [PFIs](/docs/tbdex/pfi/overview) in a tbDEX network.

Common examples of credentials that are necessary in financial transactions are ones that verify the identity of a Wallet owner.

Although credential issuance is not a concept that is exclusive to tbDEX, it's a key element in enabling compliant transactions.

## Overview

A Credential Issuance app operates as an API service, exposing endpoints for third parties to request credentials.

If you already have an Issuance app up and running, check out the guide on [how to issue credentials with Web5](/docs/web5/build/verifiable-credentials/vc-issuance/).

If you need to create a Credential Issuance app from scratch, continue on with this guide:

<LanguageSwitchBlock>
  <div language="Kotlin">
    * Create a web server using <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/ktor.html#run_ktor_app">Ktor</a> that will serve as an API endpoint.
  </div>
  <div language="JavaScript">
    * Create a web server using <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> that will serve as an API endpoint.
  </div>
</LanguageSwitchBlock>
* Design the credential you'd like to offer.
* Implement an issuance path where you'll accept a request for issuance, perform any necessary checks, and issue the credential.
* Return the credential to the requester.

## Environment Setup

<LanguageSwitchBlock>
  <div language="Kotlin">
    <p>
    <h3> Setup Ktor Project </h3>

This example demonstrates how to use Ktor to set up the VC issuance service. Follow these instructions to <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/ktor.html#new_ktor_project">create a new Ktor project</a>.

</p>

  </div>

  <div language="JavaScript">
    <p>
<h3> Install Express </h3>

This example demonstrates how to use Express to set up the VC issuance service. Follow these instructions to <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html">install Express</a>.

</p>

  </div>
</LanguageSwitchBlock>

### Install Credentials Package

You'll also need to install `@web5/credentials` to create and issue credentials:

<Shnip
  inlineSnippets={[
    {
      code: `npm install @web5/credentials`,
      language: 'JavaScript',
      codeLanguage: 'bash',
    },
    {
      code: `// Configure repositories
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
  maven("https://jitpack.io")
  maven("https://repo.danubetech.com/repository/maven-public/")
}
// Configure dependencies
dependencies {
  implementation("xyz.block:web5-credentials:0.0.11")
}`,
      language: 'Kotlin',
      breakLineAt: [5],
      title: 'build.gradle.kts',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Create a DID

Additionally, to issue credentials, you need a [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers) which will serve as your Issuer's identity.
If you don't already have one, you'll need to [create a DID](/docs/web5/build/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did).

### Create API Service

<LanguageSwitchBlock>
  <div language="Kotlin">
    <p>
1. Ensure you have a file, such as <code>Application.kt</code>, to act as your API's entry point, which was created during the Ktor setup.

2. Within the file, import the necessary libraries:

```kt title=Application.kt
import com.nimbusds.jwt.JWTParser
import io.ktor.server.application.*
import io.ktor.server.response.*
import io.ktor.server.request.*
import io.ktor.server.routing.*
import io.ktor.http.*
import io.ktor.server.engine.*
import io.ktor.server.netty.*
import web5.sdk.credentials.VerifiableCredential
import java.security.SignatureException
import com.nimbusds.jwt.JWTClaimsSet
import web5.sdk.dids.Did
```

3. To start your API service, add the following:

```kt title=Application.kt
fun main() {
  embeddedServer(Netty, port = 8082) { // this can be any port you want to listen on
      configureRouting()
  }.start(wait = true)
}
```

4. next, in the same file define your API routes:

```kt title=Application.kt
fun Application.configureRouting() {
        routing {
            get("/check-sanctions") {
             // implement the API route here
            }
        }
}
```

   </p>

   </div>

<div language="JavaScript">
<p>
1. Ensure you have a file, such as <code>main.js</code>, to act as your API's entry point, which was created during the Express setup.

2. Within the file, import the following:

```js title=main.js
import { api } from './api.js';
```

3. To start your Express API service, add the following:

```js title=main.js
const config = {
  port: 3000, // this can be any port you want to listen on
};

const server = api.listen(config.port, () => {
  log.info(`Server listening on port ${config.port}`);
});
```

4. Next, create an <code>api.js</code> file. This file will define the core API routes and logic for issuing credentials:

```js title=api.js
import express from 'express';
import { VerifiableCredential, Jwt } from '@web5/credentials';
// The next step will cover designing this class
import SanctionsCredential from './sanctionsCredential.js';

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.get('/check-sanctions', async (req, res) => {
  // implement the API route here
});

// Export the app so it can be imported in your <code>main.js</code> file
export { app as api };
```

</p>

  </div>
</LanguageSwitchBlock>

With this basic structure, you can now design a credential and implement your issuance path.

:::

## Design the Credential

With your app set up to accept incoming routes, you can design a model class to represent the specific type of credential you'd like to issue.

Let's design a VC that attests that a person isn't on a Sanctions list. You could model that class as follows:

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    {
      snippetName: 'sanctionsCredentialClass',
      language: 'JavaScript',
      title: 'sanctionsCredential.js',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'sanctionsCredentialClassKt',
      language: 'Kotlin',
      title: 'Application.kt',
    },
  ]}
/>

In the example above, you provide a class property that stores all the sanctions lists checked against.
You have wide flexibility with what you can store in the credential model class, which means that you're free to include any attributes that may be relevant to the credential you are issuing.

## Implement Issuance

With your web server structure in place and credential designed, you're now ready to build out your issuance codepath.
Within the `/check-sanctions` route, you'll add code to handle when a user requests to be issued a VC.

In this code, you'll want to perform any checks required to issue them a credential which will later be verified by an interested third party.

In the example below, assume the user has provided a JWT that contains their identity information (e.g. name, DOB, etc), and your application checks applicable sanctions lists to determine if this user is on them.

If all checks pass, you'll issue them a credential.

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    {
      snippetName: 'checkSanctionsEndpoint',
      language: 'JavaScript',
      title: 'api.js',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'checkSanctionsEndpointKt',
      language: 'Kotlin',
      title: 'Application.kt',
    },
  ]}
/>

:::tip Signing credentials
Signing will return a [VC JSON Web Token](/docs/web5/build/verifiable-credentials/jwt-to-vc#what-is-a-jwt), which is ideal for secure transmission of the credential.

A BearerDid is used to sign Verifiable Credentials that you issue.
Refer to the [Create A DID](/docs/web5/build/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did) guide for steps on how to create one.
:::

<LanguageSwitchBlock>
  <div language="Kotlin">
    <p>
In order to run this code, create a <code>checkSanctionsLists()</code> function and a <code>sanctionsListResult</code> class in your <code>Application.kt</code> file:
   </p>
  </div>

  <div language="JavaScript">
    <p>
In order to run this code, create a <code>checkSanctionsLists()</code> function in your <code>api.js</code> file:
    </p>
  </div>
</LanguageSwitchBlock>

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    {
      snippetName: 'checkSanctionsListsFunction',
      language: 'JavaScript',
      title: 'api.js',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'checkSanctionsListsFunctionAndSanctionsListResultClassKt',
      language: 'Kotlin',
      title: 'Application.kt',
    },
  ]}
/>

The `sanctions_credential` object that's returned will be a raw VC that looks like this:

<LanguageSwitchBlock>
  <div language="JavaScript">
    <p>

```json
vcDataModel: {
  "@context": [ "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1" ],
  type: [ "VerifiableCredential", "SanctionsCredential" ],
  id: "urn:uuid:daa5ff01-9b7d-485b-9410-22a42952d46c",
  issuer: "did:dht:yqun8fjakb7afu3rau9rhgdo4ahru9d68488e5mu5ihbaiwqjh3y",
  issuanceDate: "2023-12-14T08:20:41Z",
  credentialSubject: {
    id: "did:key:z6MkjGSeekPGE9QfczHWyW8v2ZzJU68kqSHzV7L2dmQyuyDu",
    listsCleared: "FBI's Most Wanted", "USA Watchlist", "EU Watchlist"
  }
}
```

   </p>

   </div>

<div language="Kotlin">
<p>

```json
{
  "@context": [ "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1" ],
  type: [ "VerifiableCredential", "SanctionsCredential" ],
  id: "urn:uuid:daa5ff01-9b7d-485b-9410-22a42952d46c",
  issuer: "did:dht:yqun8fjakb7afu3rau9rhgdo4ahru9d68488e5mu5ihbaiwqjh3y",
  issuanceDate: "2023-12-14T08:20:41Z",
  credentialSubject: {
    id: "did:key:z6MkjGSeekPGE9QfczHWyW8v2ZzJU68kqSHzV7L2dmQyuyDu",
    listsCleared: "FBI's Most Wanted", "USA Watchlist", "EU Watchlist"
  }
}
```

</p>

  </div>
</LanguageSwitchBlock>

## Test Issuance Service

1. Start the service by opening a terminal window and running the following commands:

<LanguageSwitchBlock>
  <div language="JavaScript">
    <p>

```bash
node main.js
```

   </p>

   </div>

<div language="Kotlin">
<p>

```bash
./gradlew clean build
./gradlew run
```

</p>

  </div>
</LanguageSwitchBlock>

2. In a new terminal window send a test request. Below is an example command using `curl` that includes a JWT for authorization:

```bash
 curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/check-sanctions -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImtpZCI6ImRpZDprZXk6ejZNa3djSmkzeVVONDJFZ1N2cmNHRlFyQzRKY1pkenlWWkhQOVdmMXFRZWRuVlRQI3o2TWt3Y0ppM3lVTjQyRWdTdnJjR0ZRckM0SmNaZHp5VlpIUDlXZjFxUWVkblZUUCJ9.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.7oFAPckx-vxCbbzKSk9bU7eXlnjBFvMborl9woHCbcvWaLt0LvTRuDfvGDPC24V9D1K5OFpTnnBiN5jtIOmbBg"
```

With that, you've implmented a basic credential issuance service to accept requests and issue VCs.
