# Credential Issuance Server Setup

</LanguageSwitchBlock>

### Install Credentials Package

You'll also need to install `@web5/credentials` to create and issue credentials:

<Dependencies languageDependencies={[
  { language: 'javascript', dependencies: ['@web5/credentials'] },
  { language: 'maven', dependencies: ['web5-credentials'] },
  { language: 'gradle', dependencies: ['web5-credentials'] },
]}/>

### Create a DID

Additionally, to issue credentials, you need a [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/what-are-dids) which will serve as your Issuer's identity.

If you don't already have one, you'll need to [create a DID](/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did) with an IDV (Identity Verification) service endpoint:

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    {
      snippetName: 'createADidWithServiceEndpointJS',
      language: 'JavaScript',
      title: 'did.js',
    },
    {
      snippetName: 'createADidWithAServiceEndpointKT',
      language: 'Kotlin',
      title: 'Application.kt',
    },
  ]}
/>

If you have an existing DID you'll need to update that DID Document with an IDV service endpoint:

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    {
      snippetName: 'updateADidWithServiceEndpointJS',
      language: 'JavaScript',
      title: 'did.js',
    }
  ]}
  inlineSnippets={[
    {
      code: `Updating a DID Document with a service endpoint is not currently supported in Kotlin.`,
      language: 'Kotlin',
      codeLanguage: 'text',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Create API Service

<LanguageSwitchBlock>
  <div language="Kotlin">
    <p>
1. Ensure you have a file, such as <code>Application.kt</code>, to act as your API's entry point, which was created during the Ktor setup.

2. Within the file, import the necessary libraries:

```kt title=Application.kt
import com.nimbusds.jwt.JWTParser
import io.ktor.server.application.*
import io.ktor.server.response.*
import io.ktor.server.request.*
import io.ktor.server.routing.*
import io.ktor.http.*
import io.ktor.server.engine.*
import io.ktor.server.netty.*
import web5.sdk.credentials.VerifiableCredential
import java.security.SignatureException
import com.nimbusds.jwt.JWTClaimsSet
import web5.sdk.dids.Did
```

3. To start your API service, add the following:

```kt title=Application.kt
fun main() {
  embeddedServer(Netty, port = 8082) { // this can be any port you want to listen on
      configureRouting()
  }.start(wait = true)
}
```

4. In the same file, define your API routes:

```kt title=Application.kt
fun Application.configureRouting() {
        routing {
            get("/example-route") {
             // implement the API route here
            },
            get("/next-example-route") {
             // implement the API route here
            }
        }
}
```

   </p>

   </div>

<div language="JavaScript">
<p>
1. Ensure you have a file, such as <code>main.js</code>, to act as your API's entry point, which was created during the Express setup.

2. Within the file, import the following:

```js title=main.js
import { api } from './api.js';
```

3. To start your Express API service, add the following:

```js title=main.js
const config = {
  port: 3000, // this can be any port you want to listen on
};

const server = api.listen(config.port, () => {
  log.info(`Server listening on port ${config.port}`);
});
```

4. Next, create an <code>api.js</code> file. This file will define the core API routes and logic for issuing credentials:

```js title=api.js
import express from 'express';
import { VerifiableCredential, Jwt } from '@web5/credentials';

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.get('/example-route', async (req, res) => {
  // implement the API route here
});

// Export the app so it can be imported in your <code>main.js</code> file
export { app as api };
```

</p>

  </div>

## Next Steps

Now that you have your server environment set up, depending on your use case, you can proceed with one of the following guides:
