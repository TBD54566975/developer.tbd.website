# Message Types

PFIs and Wallets are able to communicate with each other by using the following tbDEX message types:

* [**RFQ**](/docs/tbdex/api-reference/tbdex-js/protocol/classes/Rfq) - A message sent by a wallet to a PFI requesting a quote for an ask

* [**Quote**](/docs/tbdex/pfi/creating-quotes) - A quote sent by the PFI in response to an RFQ, including a locked-in price that the PFI is willing to honor until a built-in expiration date

* [**Order**](/docs/tbdex/pfi/processing-orders) - a message sent by a wallet to a PFI to accept a quote

* [**OrderStatus**](/docs/tbdex/pfi/processing-orders#provide-an-initial-orderstatus) - A message sent by the PFI to a wallet to convey the current status of an order.

* [**Close**](/docs/tbdex/pfi/processing-orders#close-the-order) - A message sent by a wallet or a PFI in response to an RFQ or Quote

Additionally PFIs offer a list of [Offerings](/docs/tbdex/pfi/creating-offerings), which is represented by a resource used to describe a currency pair that can be exchanged and includes requirements, conditions, and constraints needed to fulfill the described swap. 
Wallets can fetch a PFI's list of Offerings and present them to their users.
