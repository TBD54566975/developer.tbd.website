# Overview

A Participating Financial Institution (PFI) is an entity that offers liquidity on the tbDEX network. PFIs make themselves known to Wallets/Agents and engage in verifying  necessary information for transaction completion with Verifiable Credentials Issuers. For more on how PFIs fit into the overall structure of tbDEX, please [refer to the tbDEX overview](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/tbdex/#messages).

This guide is intended for developers looking to implement software to participate as a PFI on the tbDEX network and aims to provide an understanding of the key SDKs, code snippets, design, and concepts of tbDEX. By the end of this guide, youâ€™ll have what you need to begin participating on the tbDEX network.
