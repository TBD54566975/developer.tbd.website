# tbDEX PFI in 5️⃣ Minutes

## Overview

In the tbDEX ecosystem, a [Participating Financial Institution (PFI)](/docs/tbdex/pfi/overview) provides liquidity offerings to customers via [Wallets](/docs/tbdex/wallet/overview), allowing eligible customers to place orders and execute transactions.

**In this quickstart, you'll:**

✅  Set up a basic PFI with a catalog of `Offerings`

✅  Provide a `Quote` when requested

✅  Process a `Order`

Let's get started!

## Set Up PFI

### Create a DID

On tbDEX, PFIs are identified using [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/what-are-dids). Let's create a DID for your PFI and specify a service endpoint that allows Wallet applications to interact with your PFI:

<CodeSnippet snippetName="pfiOverviewCreateDid" />
<PfiQuickstartCodeRunner executeCodeName="executeDidCreate" stepIndex={0} customPlaceholder={"See PFI DID"} />

### Structure Your PFI App
To operate as a PFI on the tbDEX network, you'll need a server that handles incoming requests from Wallet applications, a database that holds Offerings and Exchanges, and implementations of the OfferingsApi and ExchangesApi. We'll spare you the details in this Quickstart, however, for more info, check out the guide on [Structuring a PFI App](/docs/tbdex/pfi/anatomy-of-a-pfi).

### Fetching Offerings for Wallets
With your database populated with Offerings and the OfferingsApi set up, Wallet applications can now call `getOfferings()` to obtain a list of the currency conversions you offer and the requirements to transact. 

Let's see what Offerings your PFI provides:

```js
const offerings = await offeringsApiProvider.getOfferings();
````

<PfiQuickstartCodeRunner executeCodeName="executeGetOfferings" stepIndex={1} customPlaceholder={"Fetch Offerings from the PFI Endpoint"} viewJsonObj={true} collapseLevel={3} />

## Process tbDEX Messages

PFIs and Wallet applications exchange [messages](/docs/tbdex/message-types#messages) to facilitate transactions.
All messages are stored within an exchange in your PFI's database.

Let's walk through the process of handling these messages.

### Create Quote

When a customer selects an `Offering`, the Wallet application calls `createExchange()` passing in an `RFQ` (Request for Quote) message.
The RFQ is sent to your PFI and includes the customer's preferred methods of payment and the credentials that satisfy the `requiredClaims` of the selected `Offering`. 

Using this submitted data, your PFI generates a `Quote`:

<CodeSnippet snippetName="pfiCreateQuoteJs" title="exchangeApiProvider.ts" />

After creating this message, your PFI will sign it with your DID and write it to your database, where the Wallet app can retrieve it.
<CodeSnippet snippetName="pfiSignQuoteJs" title="exchangeApiProvider.ts" />
<PfiQuickstartCodeRunner executeCodeName="executeGetQuote" stepIndex={2} customPlaceholder={"See the Quote"} viewJsonObj={true} collapseLevel={3} />

### Process Order

The Wallet application presents the `Quote` to the customer, and they accept it.
The Wallet proceeds by calling `submitOrder()` to place an `Order`. 

When your PFI receives the `Order`, you'll settle the payin and payout outside of tbDEX using the rails of your choice, but will use the protocol to send `OrderStatus` updates so that the Wallet app can keep the customer informed:

<CodeSnippet snippetName="pfiOrderStatusJs" title="exchangeApiProvider.ts" />
<PfiQuickstartCodeRunner executeCodeName="executeGetOrderStatus" stepIndex={3} customPlaceholder={"See the OrderStatus"} viewJsonObj={true} collapseLevel={3} />

### Close Exchange

Once the `Order` is completed (whether fulfilled or cancelled), you'll terminate the exchange with a `Close` message which can optionally include a `reason` and a `success` indicator:

<CodeSnippet snippetName="pfiCloseOrderJs" title="exchangeApiProvider.ts" />
<PfiQuickstartCodeRunner executeCodeName="executeGetClose" stepIndex={4} customPlaceholder={"See the Close Message"} viewJsonObj={true} collapseLevel={3} />
