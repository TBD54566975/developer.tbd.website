# Anatomy of a PFI

To participate in the tbDEX network as a PFI, you’ll need to stand up a server that allows you to receive tbDEX protocol messages, process those messages, and provide an appropriate response. As a result, you’ll need 3 core components: 




* **A main server entry point** - this will leverage the tbDEX SDK to create an http server subscribed to tbDEX messaging.
* **An exchange API provider** - this class is responsible for implementing the ExchangeApi protocol, which is a common interface for managing the database containing your tbDEX offer, order, quote, close, and RFQ data.
* **An offering API provider** - this class is responsible for implementing the OfferingsApi protocol, which is a common interface for managing the database containing your offerings data.


### Main Server Entrypoint

Your main server entrypoint should fulfill the following responsibilities:


* Accept GET requests for offerings and exchanges data
* Handle submission requests for new RFQs, Orders, and Closes

To begin, you’ll want to configure your server with the required exchange and offerings API providers:


```js
import { TbdexHttpServer } from '@tbdex/http-server'

const httpApi = new TbdexHttpServer({ exchangesApi: ExchangeApiProvider, offeringsApi: OfferingApiProvider })
```


Referring back to the [message types](docs/tbdex/pfi/message-types), you’ll notice that of the five listed, three of them will be sent from Wallets to PFIs: RFQ, Order, and Close. As a result, you’ll want to ensure that your PFI is programmed to accept those 3 messages and set appropriate callbacks to each request:


```js
httpApi.submit('rfq', async (ctx, rfq) => {
  await ExchangeApiProvider.write({ message: rfq as Rfq })
})

httpApi.submit('order', async (ctx, order) => {
  await ExchangeApiProvider.write({ message: order as Order })
})

httpApi.submit('close', async (ctx, close) => {
  await ExchangeApiProvider.write({ message: close as Close })
})
```


With your routes configured, you’ll then want to set your server to begin listening:


```js
const server = httpApi.listen(config.port, () => {
  log.info(`Mock PFI listening on port ${config.port}`)
})
```


Now your server is configured with the appropriate routing setup!


### Exchange API Provider

The Exchanges API is the set of methods that deals with reading and writing any messages data, based on the [`ExchangesApi`](docs/tbdex/api-reference/tbdex-js/http-server/interfaces/ExchangesApi) class. Although the interface for `ExchangesApi` only requires to be filled out with read operations, you may find it useful to couple write operations into the class as well. 

Using the sample code above as reference, the submission of RFQ, Order, or Close data will result in the triggering of the Exchange API Provider’s `write()`, while the required methods such as `getOrder()` will serve as read methods. 

As a PFI developer you’ll be responsible for designing your own data storage and provider to access your data. Assuming a generic `dataProvider` class serves as your PFI’s means of accessing your Exchange data, then your `write()` implementation could look something like as follows:


```js
 async write(opts: { message: MessageKindClass }) {
  const result = await dataProvider.insert(
        'exchange',
      {
        exchangeid: message.exchangeId,
        messagekind: message.kind,
        messageid: message.id,
        subject,
        message: JSON.stringify(message)
      });
}
    
```


After writing an RFQ to the database, you’ll then want to [create a Quote](docs/tbdex/pfi/creating-quotes). Similarly, after writing an Order to your database, you’ll want to ensure you properly [process that Order](docs/tbdex/pfi/processing-orders).


### Offerings API Provider

The Offerings API is the set of methods that deals with reading and writing any offering data, based on the [OfferingsApi](docs/tbdex/api-reference/tbdex-js/http-server/interfaces/OfferingsApi) class. Although the interface for `OfferingsApi` only requires to be filled out with read operations, you may find it useful to couple write operations into the class as well. 

Although the Offerings API isn’t directly exposed in the main server entrypoint, it is still used to fetch and write offerings to your PFIs database. To get a single or multiple offerings as specified by the OfferingsApi interface, you could write the following:


```js

import { Offering } from '@tbdex/http-server'

async getOffering(opts: {id: string}): Promise<Offering> {
    const [ result ] =  await dataProvider.queryForOffering('offering', opts.id);

    if (!result) {
      return undefined
    }

    return Offering.factory(result.offering)

  }

  async getOfferings(): Promise<Offering[]> {
    const results =  await dataProvider.getOfferings('offering');

    const offerings: Offering[] = []
    for (let result of results) {
      const offering = Offering.factory(result.offering)
      offerings.push(offering)
    }

    return offerings
  }
```


Additionally, you could write offerings into your database using code that looks as follows:

```js
async create(offering: Offering) {
    let result = await dataProvider.insert(
        'offering',
      {
        offeringid: offering.id,
        payoutcurrency: offering.payoutCurrency.currencyCode,
        payincurrency: offering.payinCurrency.currencyCode,
        offering: JSON.stringify(offering)
      });
  }
```
