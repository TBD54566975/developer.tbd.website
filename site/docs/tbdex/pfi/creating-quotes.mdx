# Creating Quotes

When you receive an `RFQ` message, you’ll want to do the following:

1. Store the `RFQ` message in your database
2. Get the `Offering` specified by `offeringId` in the `RFQ`
3. Create a `Quote` and store it in your database

## Store RFQ message

An `RFQ` is the first message of an exchange. 
When a Wallet application sends your PFI an `RFQ` message, your server's `onCreateExchange()` callback parameter will be invoked.
This is where you should implement your business logic for determining the customer's exact Quote. 

As a best practice, store the `RFQ` message in your [Exchanges database](/docs/tbdex/pfi/anatomy-of-a-pfi#main-server-entrypoint) so that both you and the Wallet app can access it.


## Get the Offering

After inserting the `RFQ` into your database, you can search your database for the `Offering` the `RFQ` is requesting. 

RFQs contain a required `offeringId` field that you pass to your Offerings API provider’s `getOffering()` method to obtain the exact Offering. 

Building on the example from the [Exchange API Provider section](/docs/tbdex/pfi/anatomy-of-a-pfi#exchange-api-provider), your code might look like this:

<Shnip snippets={
  [
    { snippetName: 'pfiWriteOfferingJs', language: 'JavaScript'},
    { snippetName: 'pfiWriteOfferingKt', language: 'Kotlin'}
  ]} />


## Create a Quote

Before creating a `Quote` in response to the received `RFQ`, you may want to review the [protocol definition for Quotes](https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/tree/main/specs/protocol#quote). 
With that in mind, you can then create your quote using the `Quote.create()` method as shown below:

<Shnip snippets={
  [
    { snippetName: 'pfiCreateQuoteJs', language: 'JavaScript'},
    { snippetName: 'pfiCreateQuoteKt', language: 'Kotlin'}
  ]} />

With the `Quote` created, you’ll then sign it for authorization purposes and write it to your own database:

<Shnip snippets={
  [
    { snippetName: 'pfiSignQuoteJs', language: 'JavaScript'},
    { snippetName: 'pfiSignQuoteKt', language: 'Kotlin'}
  ]} />

:::tip Note
If the Wallet Application supplied a `replyTo` address with their RFQ, you'll send the Quote to that address.
If not, the Wallet Application will poll your PFI awaiting the Quote message to appear within the exchange.
