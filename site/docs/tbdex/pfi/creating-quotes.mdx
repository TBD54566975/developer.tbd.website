# Creating Quotes

When you receive an `RFQ` message, you’ll want to do the following:

1. Store the `RFQ` message in your database
2. Get the `Offering` specified by `offeringId` in the `RFQ`
3. Verify any claims required by the `Offering` selected
4. Create a `Quote` and store it in your database


## Get the Offering

After inserting the `RFQ` into your database, you can search your database for the `Offering` the `RFQ` is requesting. 

RFQs contain a required `offeringId` field that you pass to your Offerings API provider’s `getOffering()` method to obtain the exact Offering. 

Building on the example from the [Exchange API Provider section](/docs/tbdex/pfi/anatomy-of-a-pfi#exchange-api-provider), your code might look like this:


```js
import { Quote } from '@tbdex/http-server'

async write(opts: { message: MessageKindClass }) {
   const { message } = opts
   const subject = aliceMessageKinds.has(message.kind) ? message.from : message.to

   const result = await dataProvider.insert(
       'exchange',
     {
       exchangeid: message.exchangeId,
       messagekind: message.kind,
       messageid: message.id,
       subject,
       message: JSON.stringify(message)
     });

//highlight-start
   if (message.kind == 'rfq') {
     const offering = await offeringApiProvider.getOffering(message.offeringId)
   }
//highlight-end
}
```



## Verifying the Required Claims

After receiving an `RFQ` and finding the matching `Offering`, you’ll want to verify that the user satisfies the necessary requirements for the `Offering`. 

The `RFQ` class offers the [verifyOfferingRequirements](https://tbd54566975.github.io/tbdex-js/classes/_tbdex_http_server.Rfq.html#verifyOfferingRequirements) method to do so, which checks that the claim or credential provided in the `RFQ` satisfies the presentation definition that was specified on the `Offering`. 

```js
 function processRfq(rfq, offering) {
     try {
      await rfq.verifyOfferingRequirements(offering)
    } catch(e) {
      console.log(`Failed to verify offering requirements: ${e.rfq}`)
    }
}
```

## Creating and Sending a Quote

Before creating a `Quote` in response to the received `RFQ`, you may want to review the [protocol definition for Quotes](https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/tree/main/specs/protocol#quote). 
With that in mind, you can then create your quote using the `Quote.create()` method as shown below:

```js
const quote = Quote.create(
        {
          metadata: {
            from: config.did.id,
            to: message.from,
            exchangeId: message.exchangeId
          },
          data: {
            expiresAt: new Date(2024, 4, 1).toISOString(),
            payin: {
              currencyCode: 'BTC',
              amountSubunits: '1000'
            },
            payout: {
              currencyCode: 'KES',
              amountSubunits: '123456789'
            }
          }
        }
      )
```

With the `Quote` created, you’ll then sign it for authorization purposes and write it to your own database:


```js
await quote.sign(config.did.privateKey, config.did.kid)
this.write({ message: quote as Quote})
```


:::note
Wallet Applicationss are not addressable, and therefore are not pushed updates about Quotes. 
Therefore the Wallet Application will need to poll the PFI to get the Quote.
