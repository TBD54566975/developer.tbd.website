# Onboarding

Before beginning development of your PFI’s code, you’ll need to create an identity to make your PFI discoverable on the network. The tbDEX network is built to be decentralized, which is why you’ll need to create your own DID to assign to the PFI. That DID will represent the PFI, as well as serve as the signer for tbDEX messages and resources that are sent to other parties.
