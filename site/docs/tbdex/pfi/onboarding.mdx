# Onboarding

Before beginning development of your PFI’s code, you’ll need to create an identity to use on the network. A tbDEX network is built to be decentralized, which is why you’ll need to create your own [Decentralized Identifier](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers) (DID) to assign to the PFI. That DID will represent the PFI, as well as serve as the signer for tbDEX messages and resources that are sent to other parties.

DIDs are associated with [DID Documents](/docs/web5/learn/did_document) which describe how to engage with your PFI.


To create a DID and identify yourself as a PFI, use the [@web5/dids SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web5/dids):

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="JavaScript" value="JavaScript">
    <CodeBlock language="js">
    {`import { DidDhtMethod } from '@web5/dids' \n
const did = await DidDhtMethod.create({
  publish: true,
  services: [{
    type: 'PFI',
    id: 'pfi',
    serviceEndpoint: 'tbdex-pfi.tbddev.org'
  }]
})
    `}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin" value="Kotlin">
    <CodeBlock language="kotlin">
    {`import web5.sdk.dids.methods.dht.DidDht
import web5.sdk.crypto.InMemoryKeyManager \n
fun createDid(): DidDht {
  // Ensure key management is present to store keys
  val keyManager = InMemoryKeyManager() \n
  // Initialize or load a DID
  val did: DidDht = DidDht.create(keyManager)\n
  return did
}
    `}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that the value for `serviceEndpoint` should be the URL to your PFI's service entry.
