# Overview

PFIs are **Participating Financial Institutions** that offer liquidity on a tbDEX network. 

PFIs make themselves known to [Wallet applications](/docs/tbdex/wallet/overview) and engage in verifying  necessary information for transaction completion with [Verifiable Credential](/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials) Issuers. 

For more on how PFIs fit into the overall structure of tbDEX, please [refer to the tbDEX overview](/docs/tbdex/#example-scenario).
