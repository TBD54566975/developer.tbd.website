# Overview

PFIs are **P**articipating **F**inancial **I**nstitutions that offer liquidity on a tbDEX network. 

PFIs make themselves known to Wallet applications and engage in verifying  necessary information for transaction completion with Verifiable Credential Issuers. 

For more on how PFIs fit into the overall structure of tbDEX, please [refer to the tbDEX overview](docs/tbdex/#messages).

The PFI guides are intended to provide you with what you need to begin participating on the tbDEX network.
