# Processing Orders

This guide covers how to use tbDEX to communicate about progress on Orders you receive.

## Provide an Initial OrderStatus

Upon storing the `Order` message, you will want to create an initial <LanguageSwitchLink text="OrderStatus" links='{"JavaScript": "https://tbd54566975.github.io/tbdex-js/classes/_tbdex_http_client.OrderStatus.html", "Kotlin": "https://tbd54566975.github.io/tbdex-kt/docs/tb-d-e-x%20-s-d-k%20-documentation/tbdex.sdk.protocol.models/-order-status/index.html"}'/>  to update the Wallet on the status of their `Order`:


<Shnip snippets={
  [
    { snippetName: 'pfiOrderStatusJs', language: 'JavaScript'},
    { snippetName: 'pfiOrderStatusKt', language: 'Kotlin'}
  ]} />

If the Wallet Application supplied a `replyTo` address, you'll send the `OrderStatus` message there.
You can also write the `OrderStatus` to your database and the Wallet will poll for `OrderStatus` data.

## Process the Order

The <LanguageSwitchLink text="Order message" links='{"JavaScript": "https://tbd54566975.github.io/tbdex-js/classes/_tbdex_http_client.Order.html", "Kotlin": "https://tbd54566975.github.io/tbdex-kt/docs/tb-d-e-x%20-s-d-k%20-documentation/tbdex.sdk.protocol.models/-order/index.html"}'/> will contain the information you initially stored in an `Offering` object that will specify the pay-in, pay-out, and rate of conversion needed. 

Using that information, you’ll be able to use your logic of choice to actually fulfill that order for your customer. 

:::note
tbDEX is a messaging protocol that facilitates communication to enable transactions but does not actually provide the APIs to fulfill them. 
That responsibility lies with the transacting parties. 
:::

As you deem appropriate for your customers, you can provide them with multiple `OrderStatus` messages using the same code as in the section above.


## Close the Order

When the `Order` has reached a terminal state (e.g. order fulfilled, order rejected, etc), you can create a `Close` message, which will be the final message of the thread. 

<Shnip snippets={
  [
    { snippetName: 'pfiCloseOrderJs', language: 'JavaScript'},
    { snippetName: 'pfiCloseOrderKt', language: 'Kotlin'}
  ]} />

After writing the `Close` message to your database, the Wallet will be able to know that their transaction has closed via polling or callback.
