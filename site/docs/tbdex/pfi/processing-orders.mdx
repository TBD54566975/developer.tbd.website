# Processing Orders

As described in the [Offerings API Provider](/docs/tbdex/pfi/anatomy-of-a-pfi#offerings-api-provider) guide, you should process the orders you receive. This guide outlines how that is done.

### Provide an Initial OrderStatus

Upon storing the `Order` message, you will want to create an initial [OrderStatus](https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/tree/main/specs/protocol#orderstatus) to update the Wallet on the status of their `Order`:


```js
import { Order, OrderStatus } from '@tbdex/http-server'

    if (message.kind == 'order') {
      const orderStatus = OrderStatus.create(
        {
          metadata: {
            from: config.did.id,
            to: message.from,
            exchangeId: message.exchangeId
          },
          data: {
            orderStatus: 'PROCESSING'
          }
        }
      )
      await orderStatus.sign(config.did.privateKey, config.did.kid)
      this.write({ message: orderStatus as OrderStatus})
    }
```


Since the Wallet application isn't addressable, you’ll write the `OrderStatus` to your database and the Wallet will poll for `OrderStatus` data.


### Process the Order

The [Order message](https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/tree/main/specs/protocol#order) will contain the information you initially stored in an `Offering` object that will specify the pay-in, pay-out, and rate of conversion needed. 

Using that information, you’ll be able to use your logic of choice to actually fulfill that order for your customer. 

Note that tbDEX is a messaging protocol that facilitates communication to enable transactions but does not actually provide the APIs to fulfill them. 
That responsibility lies with each PFI. 

As you deem appropriate for your customers, you can provide them with multiple `OrderStatus` messages using the same code as in the section above.


### Close the Order

When the `Order` has reached a terminal state (e.g. order fulfilled, order rejected, wallet canceled, etc), you can write the `Close` message to your database. Here's an example of a `Close` message:


```js
{
  "metadata": {
    "from": "did:key:z6MkvUm6mZxpDsqvyPnpkeWS4fmXD2jJA3TDKq4fDkmR5BD7",
    "to": "did:ex:pfi",
    "exchangeId": "rfq_01ha83pkgnfxfv41gpa44ckkpz",
    "kind": "close",
    "id": "close_03ha83trerk6t9tkg7q42s48j",
    "createdAt": "2023-09-13T20:28:40.345Z"
  },
  "data": {
    "reason": "Rejecting Quote"
  },
  "signature": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImtpZCI6ImRpZDprZXk6ejZNa3ZVbTZtWnhwRHNxdnlQbnBrZVdTNGZtWEQyakpBM1RES3E0ZkRrbVI1QkQ3I3o2TWt2VW02bVp4cERzcXZ5UG5wa2VXUzRmbVhEMmpKQTNUREtxNGZEa21SNUJENyJ9..tWyGAiuUXFuVvq318Kdz-EJJgCPCWEMO9xVMZD9amjdwPS0p12fkaLwu1PSLxHoXPKSyIbPQnGGZayI_v7tPCA"
}
```


After writing the `Close` message to your database, the Wallet will be able to know that their transaction has closed via polling.
