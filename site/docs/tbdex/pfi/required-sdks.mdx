# Required SDKs

To implement a PFI, you’ll need to make use of the following SDKs:


* [**web5/dids**](https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-js) - In order to deal with [Decentralized Identifiers (DID)](docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers), including verifying identities and performing any other required cryptographic functions, you’ll need the appropriate DID SDK.
* [**web5/credentials**](https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-js) - As a PFI you’ll want to verify information about your customers, including things like they’re identity or whether they’re on a sanctions list. Verifiable Credentials provide a decentralized and trustworthy way of proving facts about an entity.
* [**tbdex/server**](https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex-js) - To send and receive messages on the tbDEX network, you’ll need a networking solution. This SDK provides convenience methods for setting up routing and networking to facilitate your PFI.

To obtain the required tbDEX SDKs in your project, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @tbdex/http-server
```

With this installed, you'll make imports that look something like this in your project:

```js
import { TbdexHttpServer } from `@tbdex/http-server`
import type { Rfq, Order, Close } from '@tbdex/http-server'

```
