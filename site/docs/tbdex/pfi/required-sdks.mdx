# Required SDKs

To implement and operate as a PFI, you’ll need to use the following SDKs:


* [**web5/dids**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web5/dids) - To work with [Decentralized Identifiers (DID)](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers), including creating an identity, and performing any other required cryptographic functions, you’ll need this package.
* [**web5/credentials**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web5/credentials) - Enable verification of your customer information, including information such as customer’s identity or whether a customer is on a sanctions list. Verifiable Credentials provide a decentralized and trustworthy way of verifying a customer.
