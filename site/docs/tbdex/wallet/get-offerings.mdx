# Get Offerings

An [Offering](/docs/tbdex/pfi/creating-offerings#offering-object) describes a currency pair that can be exchanged. 
They also specify any requirements, conditions, and constraints needed to fulfill the described swap. 
This can include exchange rates, minimum and maximum transaction sizes, and other relevant details.

In other words, an Offering is a way of describing a financial product that a PFI is offering on a tbDEX network. 

Let's say your customer, Alice, is looking to exchange USD for GBP.
As a wallet application, you would loop through your list of PFIs and make a request to each to obtain their list of Offerings and determine if any offer this currency pair.
You'd then provide a list of the matching Offerings to Alice, showing her the options available.

Let's walk through how this is done.

## Find Matching Offerings

Given you have a list of PFIs on your network, you can check their Offerings for any matches:

```js
const pfiDids = [/* array of PFI DIDs */];
const payinCurrencyCode = 'USD'; // Desired payin currency code
const payoutCurrencyCode = 'GBP'; // Desired payout currency code

// Array to store the matched offerings
const matchedOfferings = [];

for (const pfiDid of pfiDids) {
  //Makes a request to the PFI to get their offerings
  const { data: offerings } = await TbdexHttpClient.getOfferings({ pfiDid });

  // Filter offerings based on the currency pair
  const filteredOfferings = offerings.filter(offering =>
    offering.data.payinCurrency.currencyCode === payinCurrencyCode &&
    offering.data.payoutCurrency.currencyCode === payoutCurrencyCode
  );

  matchedOfferings.push(...filteredOfferings);
}
```

Now, you'd present the `matchedOfferings` to Alice.
