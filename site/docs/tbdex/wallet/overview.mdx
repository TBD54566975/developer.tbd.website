# Wallet Overview

Wallet applications serve as agents in facilitating exchanges for individuals seeking liquidity within the tbDEX network. 
These applications leverage the tbDEX protocol to establish and manage a curated network of [Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs)](/docs/tbdex/pfi/overview). 
This network is instrumental in providing compliant and seamless currency exchanges across various systems and international borders.

As intermediaries, Wallets often manage [decentralized identifiers (DIDs)](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers) and [verifiable credentials (VCs)](/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials) on behalf of their users. 
These elements are essential for identity verification and are strategically utilized during exchanges to ensure security and compliance with regulatory standards.

For a comprehensive understanding of how Wallet applications integrate and function within the broader tbDEX ecosystem, we recommend referring to the [tbDEX overview](/docs/tbdex/#example-scenario).

The Wallet guides are designed to equip you with the necessary insights and tools to build your network of liquidity providers. 
This network will enable you to effectively meet the diverse financial needs of your customers, fostering a secure and efficient transaction environment.
