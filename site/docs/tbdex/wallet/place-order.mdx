# Placing Orders

Once the PFI writes a [Quote](/docs/tbdex/wallet/receive-quote) message to the exchange in response to an [RFQ](/docs/tbdex/wallet/send-rfq), you'd present that Quote to your customer and give them the option to place an **Order**.

If the customer chooses to place the order, your application will create an Order object, send it to the PFI, listen for status updates, and wait until the order is closed.

## Create Order Object
To place an Order in response to a Quote, the first step is to create the `Order` object. 
This instantiates a new Order, including metadata such as the customer's DID, the PFI's DID, the exchange ID obtained from the Quote, and the tbDEX protocol version being used.

    { snippetName: 'createOrderSwift', language: 'Swift' },
  ]}
/>

## Sign Order

Then sign the Order with the customer's [Portable DID](/docs/web5/build/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did#portable-did):

    { snippetName: 'signOrderKt', language: 'Kotlin' },
    { snippetName: 'signOrderSwift', language: 'Swift' }
  ]}
/>

## Send Order
After creating and signing the Order, it needs to be sent to the PFI via the following:

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    { snippetName: 'sendOrderJS', language: 'JavaScript' },
    { snippetName: 'sendOrderKt', language: 'Kotlin' },
    { snippetName: 'sendOrderSwift', language: 'Swift' }
  ]}
/>


## Listen for Order Status Updates
As the PFI is processing the Order, they'll provide `OrderStatus` messages. 
Your application would likely want to show these status updates to your customer to keep them informed of progress.

If you provided a [callback URI](/docs/tbdex/wallet/send-rfq#send-rfq-to-pfi) when sending the RFQ, the PFI will send the `OrderStatus` messages there.

Otherwise, the PFI will write the `OrderStatus` messages to the exchange to keep you posted on the Order's status, and your application can poll the exchange to continuously check for `OrderStatus` messages until a `Close` message has been written to the exchange:

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    { snippetName: 'listenForOrderStatusJS', language: 'JavaScript' },
    { snippetName: 'listenForOrderStatusKt', language: 'Kotlin' },
    { snippetName: 'listenForOrderStatusSwift', language: 'Swift' }
  ]}
/>

## Receive Close Message

Once a `Close` message is written, the exchange is ended and no additional messages can be added to the exchange.

**Example of Close message**

```js
{
  "metadata": {
    "from": " /* PFI DID */ ",
    "to": " /* CUSTOMER DID */ ",
    "exchangeId": "rfq_01hj2g5wrzfp4tmrfkhz277g9w",
    "protocol": "1.0",
    "kind": "close",
    "id": "close_01hj2g6493fadax5xazq2d2da6",
    "createdAt": "2023-12-20T02:16:59.939Z"
  },
  "data": {
    "reason": "Order fulfilled",
    "success": true
  },
  "signature": " /* PFI's cryptographic signature */ "
}
```

When the PFI closes the Order, it's important to check the `reason` on the Close message and report that to your customer, as it could be because the transaction was completed successfully or it could be that the Order has failed.

  ]}
