# Placing Orders

Once the PFI writes a [Quote](/docs/tbdex/wallet/send-rfq#receive-quote) message to the exchange in response to an [RFQ](/docs/tbdex/wallet/send-rfq), you'd present that Quote to your customer and give them the option to place an **Order**.

If the customer chooses to place the order, your application will create an Order object, send it to the PFI, listen for status updates, and wait until the order is closed.


## Create Order Object
To place an Order in response to a Quote, the first step is to create the `Order` object. 
This instantiates a new Order, including metadata such as the customer's DID, the PFI's DID, and the exchange ID obtained from the Quote.

```js
const order = Order.create({
  metadata: {
    from: customer.did,           // Customer's DID
    to: quote.metadata.from,      // PFI's DID
    exchangeId: quote.exchangeId  // Exchange ID from the Quote
  }
});
```

## Sign Order

Then sign the Order with the customer's [Portable DID](/docs/web5/build/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did#portable-did):

```js
await order.sign(customer);    // Customer's PortableDid
```

## Send Order
After creating and signing the Order, it needs to be sent to the PFI. This is done using the `TbdexHttpClient.sendMessage` method:

```js
const orderResponse = await TbdexHttpClient.sendMessage({ message: order });
```

The response contains a `status`, where success would be `202`:

```js
{
  "status": 202,
  "headers": {}
}
```

## Listen for Order Status Updates
As the PFI is processing the Order, they'll write `OrderStatus` messages to the exchange to keep you posted on the Order's status.
Your application would likely want to show these status updates to your customer to keep them informed of progress.

Your application can poll the exchange to continuously check for `OrderStatus` messages until a `Close` message has been written to the exchange:

```js
let closedMessage;
while (!closedMessage) {

  const exchanges = await TbdexHttpClient.getExchanges({
    did: customer,
    pfiDid: order.metadata.to,
    filter: { id: order.exchangeId }
  })
  const [ exchange ] = exchanges.data;

  for (const message of exchange) {
    if (message instanceof OrderStatus) {
      //a status update to display to your customer
      const orderStatus = message.data.orderStatus;
    }
    else if (message instanceof Close){
      //final message of exchange has been written
      closedMessage = message;
    }
  }
}
```

## Receiving Close Message

Once a `Close` message is written, the exchange is ended and no additional messages can be added to the exchange.

**Example of Close message**

```js
{
  "metadata": {
    "from": " /* PFI DID */ ",
    "to": " /* CUSTOMER DID */ ",
    "exchangeId": "rfq_01hj2g5wrzfp4tmrfkhz277g9w",
    "kind": "close",
    "id": "close_01hj2g6493fadax5xazq2d2da6",
    "createdAt": "2023-12-20T02:16:59.939Z"
  },
  "data": {
    "reason": "Order fulfilled"
  },
  "signature": " /* PFI's cryptographic signature */ "
}
```

When the PFI closes the Order, it's important to check the `reason` on the Close message and report that to your customer, as it could be because the transaction was completed successfully or it could be that the Order has failed.

```js
const reasonForClose = closedMessage.data.reason;
```
