# Receiving Quotes

After [sending an RFQ](/docs/tbdex/wallet/send-rfq#send-rfq-to-pfi), the PFI will respond with an exact **Quote** for your customer. 
This message will be written to the exchange.

## Polling for Quote

If you did not provide a [callback URI](/docs/tbdex/wallet/send-rfq#send-rfq-to-pfi) when sending a RFQ, your application will need to poll the exchange until the Quote message is written:

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    { snippetContent: pollforQuoteJS, language: 'JavaScript' },
    { snippetContent: pollforQuoteKt, language: 'Kotlin' },
  ]}
/>

## Quote Object

Now that you've received a Quote, you can present it to your customer and give them the option to [place an Order](/docs/tbdex/wallet/place-order/) or cancel the exchange.

The Quote will be returned in JSON form:

```js
{
  "metadata": {
    "from": " /* PFI's DID */ ",    
    "to": " /* Customer's DID */ ",   ,
    "exchangeId": "rfq_01hj07tb0rev8avhmqd8gggnkh",
    "kind": "quote",
    "id": "quote_01hj07tb6be2htn8bbx8afcjw9",
    "createdAt": "2023-12-19T05:12:16.331Z"
  },
  "data": {
    "expiresAt": "2024-05-01T05:00:00.000Z",
    "payin": {
      "currencyCode": "BTC",
      "amountSubunits": "1000"
    },
    "payout": {
      "currencyCode": "KES",
      "amountSubunits": "123456789"
    }
  },
  "signature": " /* PFI's cryptographic signature */ "
}
```


## Cancel Exchange

After receiving the exact Quote, your customer may decide not to place an order. 
In this case, you can send a **Close** message to the PFI which will end the exchange.

To terminate the exchange, create a `Close` message, sign it with the customer's [Portable DID](/docs/web5/build/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did#portable-did), and send the message.

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    { snippetContent: cancelExchangeJS, language: 'JavaScript' },
    { snippetContent: cancelExchangeKt, language: 'Kotlin' },
  ]}
/>

At this point, the exchange has been closed, and your customer is free to start a new exchange with this PFI or any other.
