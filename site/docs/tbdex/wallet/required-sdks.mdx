# Required SDKs

To implement and operate as a Wallet on a tbDEX network, you’ll need to use the following SDKs:


* [**web5/dids**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web5/dids) - In order to create [Decentralized Identifiers (DID)](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers) for your customers and perform any other required cryptographic functions, you’ll need the DID SDK.
* [**web5/credentials**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web5/credentials) - Your application may need to present [Verifiable Credentials (VC)](/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials) to PFIs on your customers' behalf. You may also want to verify that the PFIs you wish to engage with have certain credentials.
* [**tbdex/client**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tbdex/http-client) - This SDK enables you to send tbDEX messages to PFIs.
