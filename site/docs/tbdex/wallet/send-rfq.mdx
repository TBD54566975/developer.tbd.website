# Sending RFQs

After your customer selects an Offering, the next step is to send a **Request for Quote (RFQ)** to the PFI in order to initiate the transaction.
The Offering provided an estimate, but the Quote will provide a formal offer based on the financial exchange the customer is requesting as well as the payment methods provided.

## Create the RFQ
An RFQ is a structured tbDEX message that specifies the details of the transaction your customer wishes to make. 
It includes information about the Offering, payment methods, and any required [verifiable credentials (VCs)](/docs/tbdex/wallet/managing-credentials).

To create the message, call `Rfq.create()` passing `metadata` and `data`:

```js
const rfq = Rfq.create({
  metadata: {},
  data: {},
});
```

### metadata
`metadata` identifies the DIDs of the sender (your customer) and the recipient (the PFI):

```js
const rfq = Rfq.create({
  //highlight-start
  metadata: {
    from: customer.did, // Customer DID
    to: selectedOffering.metadata.from    // PFI's DID
  },
  //highlight-end
  data: {}
});
```

### data
`data` contains the specifics of the transaction, such as the id of the Offering you're requesting the Quote for, payment methods, and credentials:

* **offeringId** - The unique identifier of the PFI's Offering the customer is interested in
* **payinSubunits** - Total amount of payin currency the customer wants to pay in exchange for payout currency
* **payinMethod** - How the customer intends to pay, including the currency and amount. This includes a `paymentDetails` object which should contain the properties defined in the Offering's `requiredPaymentDetails` JSON schema
* **payoutMethod** - How the customer wishes to receive the payout. This includes a `paymentDetails` object which should contain the properties defined in the Offering's `requiredPaymentDetails` JSON schema
* **claims** - The [VCs that satisfy the requirements of the Offer](/docs/tbdex/wallet/managing-credentials#select-credentials-that-satisfy-requirements)

```js
const rfq = Rfq.create({
  metadata: {
    from: customer.did, // Customer DID
    to: selectedOffering.metadata.from    // PFI's DID
  },
  //highlight-start
  data: {
    offeringId: selectedOffering.metadata.id,   // The ID of the selected offering
    payinSubunits: '0.012',  // The amount of the payin currency
    payinMethod: {
      kind: 'BTC_WALLET_ADDRESS',   // The method of payment
      paymentDetails: {
        btcAddress: BTC_ADDRESS       // Customer's BTC wallet address
      }           
    },
    payoutMethod: {
      kind: 'DEBIT_CARD',  // The method for receiving payout
      paymentDetails: {
        cvv: '123',
        cardNumber: '1234567890123456789',
        expiryDate: '05/25',
        cardHolderName: 'Alice Doe'
      }
    },
    claims: selectedCredentials     // Array of signed VCs required by the PFI
  }
  //highlight-end
});
```


## Sign the RFQ
Signing the RFQ ensures its authenticity. You can do so with the customer's [Portable DID](/docs/web5/build/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did#portable-did):

```js
await rfq.sign(customer); // Customer's PortableDid
```

## Send RFQ to PFI
Use `TbdexHttpClient` to send the RFQ to the PFI:

```js
const rfqResponse = await TbdexHttpClient.sendMessage({ message: rfq });
```

The response contains a `status`, where success would be `202`:

```js
{
  "status": 202,
  "headers": {}
}
```

## Receive Quote

At this point, the RFQ has been successfully sent to the PFI and an **exchange** has been created.
This exchange serves as a thread of messages between your application and the PFI regarding this transaction.

Your application will poll this exchange until a `Quote` message appears in the exchange:

```js
let quote;

//Wait for Quote message to appear in the exchange
while (!quote) {
  const exchanges = await TbdexHttpClient.getExchanges({
    pfiDid: rfq.metadata.to,
    did: customer,
    filter: { id: rfq.exchangeId }
  });

  const [ exchange ] = exchanges.data;
  quote = exchange.find(msg => msg instanceof Quote);

  if (!quote) {
    // Wait 2 seconds before making another request
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
  }
}
```

The Quote will be returned in JSON form:

```js
{
  "metadata": {
    "from": " /* PFI's DID */ ",    
    "to": " /* Customer's DID */ ",   ,
    "exchangeId": "rfq_01hj07tb0rev8avhmqd8gggnkh",
    "kind": "quote",
    "id": "quote_01hj07tb6be2htn8bbx8afcjw9",
    "createdAt": "2023-12-19T05:12:16.331Z"
  },
  "data": {
    "expiresAt": "2024-05-01T05:00:00.000Z",
    "payin": {
      "currencyCode": "BTC",
      "amountSubunits": "1000"
    },
    "payout": {
      "currencyCode": "KES",
      "amountSubunits": "123456789"
    }
  },
  "signature": " /* PFI's cryptographic signature */ "
}
```

Now that you've received a Quote, you can present this to your customer and give them the option to [place an Order](/docs/tbdex/wallet/place-order).
