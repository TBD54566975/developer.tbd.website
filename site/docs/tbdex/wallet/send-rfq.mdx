# Sending RFQs

After your customer selects an [Offering](/docs/tbdex/pfi/creating-offerings), the next step is to send a **Request for Quote (RFQ)** to the PFI in order to initiate the transaction.
The Offering provided an estimate, but the Quote will provide a formal offer based on the financial transaction the customer is requesting as well as the payment methods provided.

## Create the RFQ
An RFQ is a structured tbDEX message that specifies the details of the transaction your customer wishes to make.
It includes information about the Offering, payment methods, and any required [verifiable credentials (VCs)](/docs/tbdex/wallet/managing-credentials).

To create the message, construct an RFQ passing metadata and data:

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    { snippetName: 'skeletonRfqMessageJS', language: 'JavaScript' },
    { snippetName: 'skeletonRfqMessageKt', language: 'Kotlin' },
    { snippetName: 'skeletonRfqMessageSwift', language: 'Swift' }
  ]}
/>

### metadata
The metadata properties identify the DIDs of the sender (your customer), the recipient (the PFI), and the version of the tbDEX protocol you're using:

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    { snippetName: 'rfqMetadataJS', language: 'JavaScript' },
    { snippetName: 'rfqMetadataKt', language: 'Kotlin' },
    { snippetName: 'rfqMetadataSwift', language: 'Swift' },
  ]}
/>

### data
The data properties contain the specifics of the transaction, such as the id of the Offering you're requesting the Quote for, payment methods, and credentials:

* **offeringId** - The unique identifier of the PFI's Offering the customer is interested in
* **payinAmount** - Total amount of payin currency the customer wants to pay in exchange for payout currency
* **payinMethod** - How the customer intends to pay, including the currency and amount. This includes a `paymentDetails` object which should contain the properties defined in the Offering's `requiredPaymentDetails` JSON schema
* **payoutMethod** - How the customer wishes to receive the payout. This includes a `paymentDetails` object which should contain the properties defined in the Offering's `requiredPaymentDetails` JSON schema
* **claims** - The [VCs that satisfy the requirements of the Offer](/docs/tbdex/wallet/managing-credentials#select-credentials-that-satisfy-requirements)

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    { snippetName: 'createRfqMessageJS', language: 'JavaScript' },
    { snippetName: 'createRfqMessageKt', language: 'Kotlin' },
    { snippetName: 'createRfqMessageSwift', language: 'Swift' },
  ]}
/>


## Sign the RFQ
Signing the RFQ ensures its authenticity. You can do so with the customer's [Portable DID](/docs/web5/build/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did#portable-did):

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    { snippetName: 'signRfqMessageJS', language: 'JavaScript' },
    { snippetName: 'signRfqMessageKt', language: 'Kotlin' },
    { snippetName: 'signRfqMessageSwift', language: 'Swift' }
  ]}
/>


## Send RFQ to PFI
Use `TbdexHttpClient` to send the RFQ to the PFI, with an optional `replyTo` property containing a valid URI where new messages from the PFI will be sent:

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    { snippetName: 'sendRfqMessageJS', language: 'JavaScript' },
    { snippetName: 'sendRfqMessageKt', language: 'Kotlin' },
    { snippetName: 'sendRfqMessageSwift', language: 'Swift' }
  ]}
/>

:::tip Callback
Callbacks are fully qualified URIs (DID or URL) that can be provided to the PFI via the `replyTo` property.

If `replyTo` is provided, the PFI will send all new messages of the exchange to the supplied URI. 
This URI is scoped to each exchange, allowing you to specify a different URI per exchange if desired. 

If `replyTo` is _not_ present, you will need to poll the PFI to receive new messages within the exchange.
:::

If no error is thrown, the RFQ has been successfully sent to the PFI and an **exchange** has been created.
This exchange serves as a thread of messages between your application and the PFI regarding this transaction.

The next message written to the exchange will be a [Quote](/docs/tbdex/wallet/receive-quote) from the PFI.
