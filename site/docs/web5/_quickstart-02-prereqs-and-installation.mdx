## Installation

:::info
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm" 
    target="_blank">Node Package Manager</a>, <code>npm</code>, installed and on your system's <code>$PATH</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Node version 18 and above</p>
  </li>
</ul>
:::

### 1. Create a directory
<p>This will be the home of your new Web5 app. In your CLI: </p> 

```bash
mkdir web5-app
cd web5-app
```

### 2. Install Web5


<p>Use NPM to install Web5:</p>

```bash
npm install @tbd54566975/web5
```

:::note
After `npm` resolves the dependency, you may see a few warnings. You can ignore these for now.
:::

This will create a `package.json` in the root of your project. Open `package.json` and add `module` as a type:

<PackageJson />

### 3. Import Web5

Let's create an `index.js` file to write our application:

```bash
touch index.js
```

Open `index.js` in your editor and add this line at the top of the file to import Web5:
```js
import { Web5 } from '@tbd54566975/web5';
```

<summary>Additional import for Node 18</summary>

```js
/*
Needs globalThis.crypto polyfill. This is *not* the crypto you're thinking of, it's the original crypto...CRYPTOGRAPHY.
*/
import { webcrypto } from "node:crypto";

if (!globalThis.crypto) {
	globalThis.crypto = webcrypto;
}

```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Additional imports for React Native</summary>

```js
/*
React Native needs crypto.getRandomValues polyfill and sha512.
This is *not* the crypto you're thinking of.
It's the original crypto...CRYPTOGRAPHY.
*/
import "react-native-get-random-values";
import { hmac } from "@noble/hashes/hmac";
import { sha256 } from "@noble/hashes/sha256";
import { sha512 } from "@noble/hashes/sha512";
ed.etc.sha512Sync = (...m) => sha512(ed.etc.concatBytes(...m));
ed.etc.sha512Async = (...m) => Promise.resolve(ed.etc.sha512Sync(...m));

secp.etc.hmacSha256Sync = (k, ...m) =>
  hmac(sha256, k, secp.etc.concatBytes(...m));
secp.etc.hmacSha256Async = (k, ...m) =>
  Promise.resolve(secp.etc.hmacSha256Sync(k, ...m));
```
</details>

Now we have the Web5 SDK installed and are ready to start building!
