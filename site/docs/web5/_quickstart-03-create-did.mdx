## 1.  Instantiate Web5 and Create DID 

In Web5 apps, a user’s unique identifier - like an email address - is called a [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers).
We are building a decentralized app, so your users are using identifiers that aren't tied to a centralized authority.

The `Web5` class is an isolated API object for doing all things Web5. The `connect()` function creates an instance of Web5 and also creates a decentralized identifier or obtains connection to an existing one.

In `index.js` below the import statement, create a new instance of `Web5`:
<CodeSnippet functionName="didCreate" />

This Web5 instance is what you'll use to access the other objects of Web5 such as `did` and `dwn`. Within the connect function we’re using `ion` as the DID method. Learn more [DID methods](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers#methods).

:::info
Web5 is split into three main top-level objects:
- web5.did
- web5.dwn
- web5.vc

  <summary>Test your code</summary>

  Wanna see the DID you just created? 
  
  In <code>index.js</code>, add the following line and save your file:
  ```js
  console.log(aliceDid);
  ```

  Then from the terminal, run:
  ```bash
  node index.js
  ```

  You'll see the newly created DID.
