## 2. Generate a Bearer DID

In the previous step, you generated what is known as a (DID), which appears as an alphanumeric string. It's more specifically referred to as a DID URI. 
This DID URI is part of a broader JSON object containing metadata such as cryptographic keys that prove ownership of the DID and rules governing its usage, management, or modification.

This object is known as a [Bearer DID](http://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/build/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did#create-did). It enables users to securely sign and verify data, ensuring authenticity and integrity.

To access your Bearer DID, add the following lines of code to your `index.js`:

<CodeSnippet snippetName="getBearerDid" />

<details>
    <summary>Test your code</summary>

Wanna see the identity you just created?

In index.js, add the following line and save your file:

```js
console.log(aliceBearerDid);
```

Then from the terminal, run:
```bash
node index.js
```

You'll see the full identity. It should resemble the output below:

```bash
BearerDid { // nested objects and properties here }
```
</details>

#### Try it!
