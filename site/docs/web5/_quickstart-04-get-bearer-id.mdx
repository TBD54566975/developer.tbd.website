## 2. Access your Bearer Identity

In the previous step, you generated what is known as a (DID), which appears as an alphanumeric string, referred to as a DID URI. 
This DID URI is part of a broader JSON object containing metadata such as cryptographic keys that prove ownership of the DID and rules governing its usage, management, or modification. 
This object is known as your BearerIdentity. It enables you to securely sign and verify data, ensuring authenticity and integrity.

To access your Bearer Identity, add the following lines of code to your `index.js`:

<CodeSnippet snippetName="getBearerDid" />

<details>
    <summary>Test your code</summary>

Wanna see the identity you just created?

In index.js, add the following line and save your file:

```js
console.log(alice);
```

Then from the terminal, run:
```bash
node index.js
```

You'll see the full identity. It should resemble the output below:

```bash
BearerIdentity { // nested objects and properties here }
```
</details>

#### Try it!
