## 3. Create a VC

[Verifiable Credentials (VCs)](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials) are digital badges of proof used to confirm specific facts or achievements about individuals, organizations, or entities. 
Typically, a trusted authority would issue a Verifiable Credential. For example, a university might issue a VC to prove that you have completed a degree program.

In this step, you'll enable your users to create a self-signed VC -- allowing them to issue a Verifiable Credential that makes claims about themselves. For this example, the credential will state that the user has completed the Web5 Quickstart Guide.

In your `index.js`, create your Verifiable Credential:

<CodeSnippet snippetName="createQuickstartVc" />

<details>
    <summary>Test your code</summary>

Wanna see the VC you just created?

In index.js, add the following line and save your file:

```js
console.log(vc);
```

Then from the terminal, run:
```bash
node index.js
```

You'll see the newly created VC. It should resemble the output below:

```bash
VerifiableCredential {}
```
</details>

Enter a username in the input field and click "Run" to create a Verifiable Credential.
