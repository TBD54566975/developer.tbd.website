## 3. Read DWN Records

If the user has given your app read permissions to their DWN, you can read their data by accessing it through the `record` property. If you don't already have access to the record, you can [query](/docs/web5/build/decentralized-web-nodes/query-from-dwn) to obtain it.

To return the text data stored in the `record`, add the following to `index.js`:
```js
const readResult = await record.data.text();
```

<details>
<summary>Test your code</summary>
<p>
To see the record that was read from the DWN, add the following to <code>index.js</code>:

```js
console.log('readResult', readResult)
```

Then from the terminal, run:

```bash
node index.js
```

The output will resemble:

```
Hello Web5
```

#### Try it!
