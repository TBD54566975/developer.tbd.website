## 5. Store your VC in your DWN

Let's store your VC in your Decentralized Web Node(DWN).

A DWN is a personal data store - a platform for messages, pictures, videos, medical records, and just about any content a user may want to store.

Your app should not store users' data in your centralized database. Instead, their data should be stored in their DWN. This is how the user retains ownership over their content. Through permissions, users can decide which apps can read, write, and delete content from their DWN.

The DWN exists in local storage under the name dwn-info. The DWN persists across browser sessions and can be synched across a user's devices.

A user can host their DWN in mulitple locations. The Web5 SDK is both browser and Node.js compliant, meaning you can use the same APIs on both client side and serverside.

To store your VC in your DWN, add the following lines of code to your `index.js`:

<CodeSnippet snippetName="writeQuickstartVcToDwn" />

When an issuer signs a VC, it attests that they are truly the one who issued it. 
This cryptographic process also converts the VC into a JSON Web Token (JWT), making the credential tamper-evident and verifiable by others.

Wanna see the identity you just imported?

In index.js, add the following line and save your file:

```js
console.log('writeResult', record);
```

Then from the terminal, run:
```bash
node index.js
```

You'll see the record that was written to the user's DWN. It will resemble:
```bash
writeResult _Record {}
```
