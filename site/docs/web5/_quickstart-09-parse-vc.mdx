## 7. Parse VC

Upon receiving a Verifiable Credential (VC) as a JSON Web Token (JWT), applications can convert it back to JSON format using the `VerifiableCredential.parseJwt()` method. 
This allows you to inspect the contents of the VC in a readable format.

Add the following lines to your index.js to parse and inspect your JWT-encoded VC:

<CodeSnippet snippetName="parseQuickstartVc" />

<details>
    <summary>Test your code</summary>

Wanna see the parsed JWT?

In index.js, add the following line and save your file:

```js
console.log(parsedVc);
```

Then from the terminal, run:
```bash
node index.js
```


You will see a decoded version of the JWT!
