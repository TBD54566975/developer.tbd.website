## Summary

Congrats! You've successfully created an application with two key functionalities:

1️⃣ Issuing and cryptographically signing Verifiable Credentials, providing users with a reliable way to verify facts about individuals, organizations, or entities.

2️⃣ Creating a local Decentralized Web Node (DWN) as a personal data store for users. With their DID and appropriate permissions, your app can read, write, or delete data from the user's DWN, ensuring they have full control over their content.
