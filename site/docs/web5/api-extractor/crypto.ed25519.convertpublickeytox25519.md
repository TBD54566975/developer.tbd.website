## Ed25519.convertPublicKeyToX25519() method

Converts an Ed25519 public key to its X25519 counterpart.

This method is useful when transitioning from signing to encryption operations, as Ed25519 and X25519 keys share the same mathematical foundation but serve different purposes. Ed25519 keys are used for digital signatures, while X25519 keys are used for key exchange in encryption protocols like Diffie-Hellman.

**Signature:**

```typescript
static convertPublicKeyToX25519(options: {
        publicKey: Uint8Array;
    }): Promise<Uint8Array>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  options | { publicKey: Uint8Array; } | The options for the conversion. |

**Returns:**

Promise&lt;Uint8Array&gt;

A Promise that resolves to the X25519 public key as a Uint8Array.
