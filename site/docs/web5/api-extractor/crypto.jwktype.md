## JwkType type

JSON Web Key Types

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type JwkType = 
/**
 * Elliptic Curve
 * Used with Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Elliptic
 * Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), including secp256k1, P-256, P-384, and P-521.
 */
'EC'
/**
 * RSA
 * Widely used for encryption and digital signatures. RSA keys are used in
 * various algorithms like RS256, RS384, RS512, etc.
 */
 | 'RSA'
/**
 * Octet sequence
 * Used with symmetric signing (e.g., HMAC HS256, HS512, etc.) and
 * symmetric encryption (e.g., A256CBC-HS512, A256GCM, etc.) algorithms.
 */
 | 'oct'
/**
 * Octet string key pairs (OKP)
 * A type of public key that is used with algorithms such as EdDSA (Ed25519 and
 * Ed448 curves) and ECDH (X25519 and X448 curves).
