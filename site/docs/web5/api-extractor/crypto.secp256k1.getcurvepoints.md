## Secp256k1.getCurvePoints() method

Returns the elliptic curve points (x and y coordinates) for a given secp256k1 key.

In the case of a private key, the public key is first computed from the private key, then the x and y coordinates of the public key point on the elliptic curve are returned.

In the case of a public key, the x and y coordinates of the key point on the elliptic curve are returned directly.

The returned coordinates can be used to perform various operations on the elliptic curve, such as addition and multiplication of points, which can be used in various cryptographic schemes and protocols.

**Signature:**

```typescript
static getCurvePoints(options: {
        key: Uint8Array;
    }): Promise<{
        x: Uint8Array;
        y: Uint8Array;
    }>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  options | { key: Uint8Array; } | The options for the operation. |

**Returns:**

Promise&lt;{ x: Uint8Array; y: Uint8Array; }&gt;

A Promise that resolves to an object with properties 'x' and 'y', each being a Uint8Array representing the x and y coordinates of the key point on the elliptic curve.
