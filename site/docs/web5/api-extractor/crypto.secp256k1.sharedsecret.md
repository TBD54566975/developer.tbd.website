## Secp256k1.sharedSecret() method

Generates a RFC6090 ECDH shared secret given the private key of one party and the public key another party.

Note: When performing Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement, the resulting shared secret is a point on the elliptic curve, which consists of an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate. With a 256-bit curve like secp256k1, each of these coordinates is 32 bytes (256 bits) long. However, in the ECDH process, it's standard practice to use only the x-coordinate of the shared secret point as the resulting shared key. This is because the y-coordinate does not add to the entropy of the key, and both parties can independently compute the x-coordinate, so using just the x-coordinate simplifies matters.

**Signature:**

```typescript
static sharedSecret(options: {
        compressedSecret?: boolean;
        privateKey: Uint8Array;
        publicKey: Uint8Array;
    }): Promise<Uint8Array>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  options | { compressedSecret?: boolean; privateKey: Uint8Array; publicKey: Uint8Array; } |  |

**Returns:**

Promise&lt;Uint8Array&gt;
