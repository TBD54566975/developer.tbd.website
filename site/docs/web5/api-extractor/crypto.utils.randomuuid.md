## utils.randomUuid() function

Generates a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) using a cryptographically strong random number generator following the version 4 format, as specified in RFC 4122.

A version 4 UUID is a randomly generated UUID. The 13th character is set to '4' to denote version 4, and the 17th character is one of '8', '9', 'A', or 'B' to comply with the variant 1 format of UUIDs (the high bits are set to '10').

The UUID is a 36 character string, including hyphens, and looks like this: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-axxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

Note that while UUIDs are not guaranteed to be unique, they are practically unique" given the large number of possible UUIDs and the randomness of generation.

After generating the UUID, the function securely wipes the memory areas used to hold temporary values to prevent any possibility of the random values being unintentionally leaked or retained in memory.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare function randomUuid(): string;
```
**Returns:**

string

A UUID string in version 4 format.
