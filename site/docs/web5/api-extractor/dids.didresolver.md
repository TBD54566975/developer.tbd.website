## DidResolver class

The `DidResolver` class is responsible for resolving DIDs to DID documents. It uses method resolvers to resolve DIDs of different methods and a cache to store resolved DID documents.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare class DidResolver 
```

## Constructors

|  Constructor | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [(constructor)(options)](./dids.didresolver._constructor_.md) |  | Constructs a new <code>DidResolver</code>. |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [resolve(didUrl, resolutionOptions)](./dids.didresolver.resolve.md) |  | <p>Resolves a DID to a DID Resolution Result. If the DID Resolution Result is present in the cache, it returns the cached result. Otherwise, it uses the appropriate method resolver to resolve the DID, stores the resolution result in the cache, and returns the resolultion result.</p><p>Note: The method signature for resolve() in this implementation must match the <code>DidResolver</code> implementation in [dwn-sdk-js](https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-sdk-js) so that Web5 apps and the underlying DWN instance can share the same DID resolution cache.</p> |
