## DidResolver.resolve() method

Resolves a DID to a DID Resolution Result. If the DID Resolution Result is present in the cache, it returns the cached result. Otherwise, it uses the appropriate method resolver to resolve the DID, stores the resolution result in the cache, and returns the resolultion result.

Note: The method signature for resolve() in this implementation must match the `DidResolver` implementation in [dwn-sdk-js](https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-sdk-js) so that Web5 apps and the underlying DWN instance can share the same DID resolution cache.

**Signature:**

```typescript
resolve(didUrl: string, resolutionOptions?: DidResolutionOptions): Promise<DidResolutionResult>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  didUrl | string | The DID or DID URL to resolve. |
|  resolutionOptions | [DidResolutionOptions](./dids.didresolutionoptions.md) | _(Optional)_ |

**Returns:**

Promise&lt;[DidResolutionResult](./dids.didresolutionresult.md)<!-- -->&gt;

A promise that resolves to the DID Resolution Result.
