## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [DidIonMethod](./dids.didionmethod.md) |  |
|  [DidKeyMethod](./dids.didkeymethod.md) |  |
|  [DidResolver](./dids.didresolver.md) | The <code>DidResolver</code> class is responsible for resolving DIDs to DID documents. It uses method resolvers to resolve DIDs of different methods and a cache to store resolved DID documents. |
|  [DidResolverCacheLevel](./dids.didresolvercachelevel.md) | Naive level-based cache for did resolution results. It just so happens that level aggressively keeps as much as it can in memory when possible while also writing to the filesystem (in node runtime) and indexedDB (in browser runtime). the persistent aspect is especially useful across page refreshes. |

## Interfaces

|  Interface | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [DidMethod](./dids.didmethod.md) |  |
|  [DidMethodApi](./dids.didmethodapi.md) |  |
|  [DidMethodOperator](./dids.didmethodoperator.md) |  |
|  [DidMethodResolver](./dids.didmethodresolver.md) |  |
|  [DidResolutionOptions](./dids.didresolutionoptions.md) | DID Resolution input metadata. |
|  [DidServiceEndpoint](./dids.didserviceendpoint.md) | A service endpoint is a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that can be used to interact with the service. |
|  [DwnServiceEndpoint](./dids.dwnserviceendpoint.md) |  |
|  [IonCreateRequestModel](./dids.ioncreaterequestmodel.md) | Data model representing a public key in the DID Document. |
|  [PortableDid](./dids.portabledid.md) | Format to document a DID identifier, along with its associated data, which can be exported, saved to a file, or imported. The intent is bundle all of the necessary metadata to enable usage of the DID in different contexts. |

## Namespaces

|  Namespace | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [utils](./dids.utils.md) |  |

## Variables

|  Variable | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [DidResolverCacheNoop](./dids.didresolvercachenoop.md) | no-op cache that is used as the default cache for did-resolver. The motivation behind using a no-op cache as the default stems from the desire to maximize the potential for this library to be used in as many JS runtimes as possible |
