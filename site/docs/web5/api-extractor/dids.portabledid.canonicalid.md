## PortableDid.canonicalId property

A DID method can define different forms of a DID that are logically equivalent. An example is when a DID takes one form prior to registration in a verifiable data registry and another form after such registration. This is the purpose of the canonicalId property.

The `canonicalId` must be used as the primary ID for the DID subject, with all other equivalent values treated as secondary aliases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
canonicalId?: string;
```
