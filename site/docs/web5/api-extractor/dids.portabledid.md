## PortableDid interface

Format to document a DID identifier, along with its associated data, which can be exported, saved to a file, or imported. The intent is bundle all of the necessary metadata to enable usage of the DID in different contexts.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export interface PortableDid 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [canonicalId?](./dids.portabledid.canonicalid.md) |  | string | <p>_(Optional)_ A DID method can define different forms of a DID that are logically equivalent. An example is when a DID takes one form prior to registration in a verifiable data registry and another form after such registration. This is the purpose of the canonicalId property.</p><p>The <code>canonicalId</code> must be used as the primary ID for the DID subject, with all other equivalent values treated as secondary aliases.</p> |
|  [did](./dids.portabledid.did.md) |  | string |  |
|  [document](./dids.portabledid.document.md) |  | [DidDocument](./dids.diddocument.md) | A set of data describing the DID subject, including mechanisms, such as cryptographic public keys, that the DID subject or a DID delegate can use to authenticate itself and prove its association with the DID. |
|  [keySet](./dids.portabledid.keyset.md) |  | [DidKeySet](./dids.didkeyset.md) | A collection of cryptographic keys associated with the DID subject. The <code>keySet</code> encompasses various forms, such as recovery keys, update keys, and verification method keys, to enable authentication and verification of the DID subject's association with the DID. |
|  [metadata?](./dids.portabledid.metadata.md) |  | [DidMetadata](./dids.didmetadata.md) | _(Optional)_ This property can be used to store method specific data about each managed DID and additional properties of any type. |
