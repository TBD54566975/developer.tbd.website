# Build a Chat App

Welcome to Web5, the magical land where Web2 and Web3 intertwine. My name is Alice. I am a wanderer in search of an application where I can send short-text messages to my best friend, Bob.

üöÄ **Your mission**

Build [Dinger](https://dinger-chat.vercel.app/), a self-sovereign, modern day pager that allows users to send short text-based messages or "dings" to each other.

üõ†Ô∏è **Your toolkit**

To build this app, you will wield the following technologies:

- [React](https://react.dev/) - A JavaScript library, your brush to paint user interfaces, craft reusable components, and manage the state of your creation.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A React metaframework, your compass to guide you through creating pages, managing routes, and managing server-side rendering.
- [Web5.js](https://developer.tbd.website/api/web5-js/) - A Web5 JavaScript SDK, your key to creating decentralized applications, facilitating direct communication between users, and granting them sovereignty over their data and identity.

üèÜ **Your reward**

By the end of this journey, you will acquire a deeper understanding of peer-to-peer communication in a Web5 ecosystem.

If you're ready for the challenge, let's get started!

:::note
This tutorial is most suitable for those who prefer to learn by doing.
:::

## Level 1: Explore the starter code

Good news! You don't have to start from scratch. There is a pre-built application that contains the user interface for Dinger. Right now, the functions in the code don‚Äôt do much. They just print messages to the console and don‚Äôt have any real actions. As you progress through the tutorial, you will add logic to the functions.
### üìù Task

To access the starter code, follow the instructions below or explore the project directly in CodeSandbox.

Note: If you don't have `pnpm` installed, you can install it by running `npm install -g pnpm`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TBD54566975/developer.tbd.website.git
cd developer.tbd.website
pnpm install
pnpm start:tutorial-dinger-starter
```

### üïµÔ∏è What to Explore
- Navigate to the `src/pages/index.js` file.
- Identify the functions that currently only print console.logs.
- Try to understand how each function interacts.

## Level 2: Connect to Web5 and create a DID
### üìù Task
Locate the line:
```javascript title="src/pages/index.js"
console.log(`this log is in initWeb5`);
```
and replace it with the following code snippet:
```javascript title="src/pages/index.js"
const { web5, did } = await Web5.connect();
setWeb5(web5);
setMyDid(did);
```

### üß© Breaking it down
- **Web5.connect()** returns a Web5 instance: It initializes and returns an instance of Web5, allowing you to interact with the Web5 ecosystem.
- **Web5.connect()** also creates or connects to a DID: A DID ([Decentralized Identifier](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers)) is a user‚Äôs unique ID card for the decentralized, digital world. It belongs only to you. `Web5.connect()` will either connect to an existing DID that you have or create a new one for you if you don't have one yet. A DID acts as an authenticator for Web5 apps, removing the need for login credentials.

## Level 3: Define and install a protocol
### üìù Task
Locate the line:
```javascript title="src/pages/index.js"
console.log(`this log is in configureProtocol`);
```

And replace it with the following code snippet:
```javascript title="src/pages/index.js"
const dingerProtocolDefinition = {
  protocol: "https://blackgirlbytes.dev/dinger-chat-protocol",
  published: true,
  types: {
    ding: {
      schema: "https://blackgirlbytes.dev/ding",
      dataFormats: ["application/json"],
    },
  },
  structure: {
    ding: {
      $actions: [
        { who: "anyone", can: "write" },
        { who: "author", of: "ding", can: "read" },
        { who: "recipient", of: "ding", can: "read" },
      ],
    },
  },
};

const { protocols, status: protocolStatus } =
  await web5.dwn.protocols.query({
    message: {
      filter: {
        protocol: "https://blackgirlbytes.dev/dinger-chat-protocol",
      },
    },
  });

if (protocolStatus.code !== 200 || protocols.length === 0) {
  const { protocolStatus } = await web5.dwn.protocols.configure({
    message: {
      definition: dingerProtocolDefinition,
    },
  });
  console.log("Configure protocol status", protocolStatus);
};
```
### üß© Breaking it down
- **dingerProtocolDefinition:** This object defines the protocol, its structure, and it grants permissions outlining who can perform specific actions like reading or writing a ding.
- **web5.dwn.protocols.query():** This function checks if the protocol already exists.
- **web5.dwn.protocols.configure():** This function installs the protocol.

### üìò Learn more
- Learn more about [protocols](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/protocols/).

## Level 4: Write to the DWN

### üìù Task
Locate the line:
```javascript title="src/pages/index.js"
console.log(`this log is in writeToDwn`);
```

And replace it with the following code snippet:
```javascript title="src/pages/index.js"
const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.write({
  data: ding,
  message: {
    protocol: "https://blackgirlbytes.dev/dinger-chat-protocol",
    protocolPath: "ding",
    schema: "https://blackgirlbytes.dev/ding",
    recipient: recipientDid,
  },
});
return record;
```

### üß© Breaking it down
- You are storing each ding on a Decentralized Web Node (DWN), or personal data store. This method **web5.dwn.records.write()** is responsible for writing data to the DWN.


### üìò Learn more
- Learn more about[ Decentralized Web Nodes](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes) and [writing DWN records](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/build/decentralized-web-nodes/write-to-dwn).

## Level 5: Send dings

### üìù Task
Locate the line:
```javascript title="src/pages/index.js"
console.log(`this log is in sendRecord`);
```

And replace it with the following code snippet:
```javascript title="src/pages/index.js"
return await record.send(recipientDid);
```

### üß© Breaking it down
- Users can have multiple DWNs, such as on their phone, laptop, or in the cloud. The method **record.send()** immediately sends the ding to all of the recipient's Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs).


### üìò Learn more
- Learn more about [sync intervals](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/sync#sync-intervals).

## Level 6: Receive dings
### üìù Task
Locate the line:
```javascript title="src/pages/index.js"
console.log(`this log is in fetchDings`);
```
And replace it with the following code snippet:
```javascript title="src/pages/index.js"
const { records, status: recordStatus } = await web5.dwn.records.query({
  message: {
    filter: {
      protocol: "https://blackgirlbytes.dev/dinger-chat-protocol",
      protocolPath: "ding",
    },
    dateSort: "createdAscending",
  },
});

try {
  const results = await Promise.all(
    records.map(async (record) => record.data.json())
  );

  if (recordStatus.code == 200) {
    const received = results.filter((result) => result?.recipient === did);
    const sent = results.filter((result) => result?.sender === did);
    setReceivedDings(received);
    setSentDings(sent);
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```
### üß© Breaking it down
- The method **web5.dwn.records.query()** queries the DWN for records matching a specified filter. In the above code snippet, it retrieves records with the protocol `https://blackgirlbytes.dev/dinger-chat-protocol` and the protocol path `ding`.

### üìò Learn more
- Learn more about how to [query DWN records](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/build/decentralized-web-nodes/query-from-dwn) and [filterable record properties](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/build/decentralized-web-nodes/query-from-dwn#filterable-record-properties).

## Level 7: Sync the UI with the DWN

### üìù Task
Locate the line:
```javascript title="src/pages/index.js"
console.log(`this log is in intervalId`);
```

And replace it with the following code snippet:
```javascript title="src/pages/index.js"
await fetchDings(web5, myDid);
```

This line is located within the following function:
```javascript title="src/pages/index.js"
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!web5 || !myDid) return;

    const intervalId = setInterval(async () => {
      console.log(`this log is in intervalId`);
    }, 2000);

    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
  }, [web5, myDid]);
```
### üß© Breaking it down
- The **useEffect()** and **setInterval()** fetch new dings every two seconds, allowing the UI to accurately display the chat.

### üìò Learn more
- Learn more about React's [useEffect()](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) hook and JavaScript's [setInterval()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval) method.

## Level 8: Try it out!
### üìù Task
Time to test the Dinger app by simulating a conversation between two users by using two different browser sessions.

**Set Up Your Browsers**:
- Open your browser in **regular mode**.
- Open a new window in **incognito/private mode**.

**Send a Message from Incognito to Regular Mode**:
- In the **incognito** window, locate and press the `Copy DID` button to copy the DID.
- Switch to the **regular mode** browser window.
- Press the `Create +` button
- Paste the copied DID into the `recipient DID` input box, then `Confirm`
- Type a short message in the `note` input box.
- Press `Send` to send the message.

**Reply from Regular Mode to Incognito**:
- In the **regular mode** window, locate and press the `Copy DID` button to copy the DID.
- Switch back to the **incognito** window.
- Press the `Create +` button
- Paste the copied DID into the `recipient DID` input box, then `Confirm`
- Type a reply in the `note` input box.
- Press `Send` to send your reply.

After following these steps, you should see a conversation taking place between the two browser sessions!

<details><summary>Not receiving any messages?</summary>
<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/sync/">Sync</a> intervals occur every two minutes. If you're eager to see immediate updates for testing purposes, you can adjust the sync settings. Update the line:

```javascript title="src/pages/index.js"
const { web5, did } = await Web5.connect();
```

to:

```javascript title="src/pages/index.js"
const { web5, did } = await Web5.connect({sync: '5s'});
```
This change forces a synchronization interval to happen every 5 seconds. However, be cautious: this is not recommended for production applications as it can lead to higher resource usage, battery drain, and potential rate limiting.
