[Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers) are associated with public and private keys. 
The private key, which should be kept secret, is used to sign information or transactions, demonstrating control over the DID. 

Proper [key management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_management) ensures that private keys are securely stored and used, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or misuse.

## Supported Types

The Web5 SDK offers two distinct `KeyManager` implementations:

* **InMemoryKeyManager**: This implementation utilizes in-memory, ephemeral storage for managing keys. 
It's ideal for scenarios where temporary key management is sufficient, such as in testing environments. 
Since the keys are stored in memory, they are lost when the application is terminated.

* **AwsKeyManager**: This implementation integrates with the [AWS Key Management Service(KMS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html), providing a secure and robust solution for key management. 
It's well-suited for production environments where a high level of security and availability are critical.

Both implementations facilitate key generation and signature operations essential for creating and managing DIDs. Each caters to distinct security needs, and the choice between them should be based on the specific requirements of your application.

## Example
Below is an example that uses `AwsKeyManager` for production environments, and `InMemoryKeyManager` for any other environments (dev, test, etc).

**Install Packages**

```bash
npm i @web5/crypto @web5/dids
```

**Import Classes**

```kotlin title="Kotlin"
import web5.sdk.crypto.AwsKeyManager
import web5.sdk.crypto.InMemoryKeyManager
import web5.sdk.crypto.KeyManager
import web5.sdk.dids.methods.dht.DidDht
import web5.sdk.dids.methods.dht.DidDhtApi
```
</details>

```kotlin title="Kotlin"
fun initKeyManagement(env: String, didUri: String?, didDhtApi: DidDhtApi): DidDht {

   // Determine which key manager to use based on the environment
    val keyManager: KeyManager = when(env) {
        "production" -> AwsKeyManager()
        else -> InMemoryKeyManager()
    }

    // Initialize or load a DID
    val did: DidDht = if (didUri == null) {
        // Create a new DID
        DidDht.create(keyManager)
    } else {
        // Load existing DID
        DidDht(uri = didUri, keyManager = keyManager, didDhtApi = didDhtApi)
    }

    return did
}
```
