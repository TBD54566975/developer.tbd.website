[Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers) are associated with public and private keys. The private key, which should be kept secret, is used to sign information or transactions, demonstrating control over the DID. Proper [key management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_management) ensures that private keys are securely stored and used, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or misuse.

The Web5 SDK provides a key manager by default, as well as the option for you to use your own.

Here's an example that uses an external [AWS Key Management Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html) for production environments, and Web5's `InMemoryKeyManager` for any other environments (dev, test, etc):

<CodeBlock language="kotlin" title="Kotlin">
{`fun initKeyManagement(env: string, didUri: string, api: DidDhtApi? = null){
    var keyManager: KeyManager;
\n
    // Determine which key manager you'd like to use based on
    // the environment
    when(env) {
        "production" -> keyManager = AwsKeyManager()
        else -> keyManager = InMemoryKeyManager()
    }
\n
    // Initialize or load a DID
    var did: DidDht;
    if (didUri == null) {
        // Create a new DID
        val did = DidDht.create(keyManager)
    } else {
        // Load existing DID
        val did = DidDht(uri = "some_uri", keyManager = keyManager, didDhtApi = api)
    }
}`}
</CodeBlock>

The `Web5` SDK provides a variety of `KeyManager` implementations, which will allow you connect to storage - in-memory storage in the case of `InMemoryKeyManager` and AWS Key Management Service in the case of `AwsKeyManager` - and allow you to perform all the operations exposed in the `KeyManager` interface.
