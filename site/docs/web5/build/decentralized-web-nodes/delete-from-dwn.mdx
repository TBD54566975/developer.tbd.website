# Delete Data from a Decentralized Web Node

Before deleting from your Decentralized Web Node (DWN), be sure to check out our [Quickstart guide](../../quickstart) to ensure you’ve properly imported the Web5 SDK. Additionally, make sure you’ve set up a DID before attempting to delete from a DWN.

## Deleting from a DWN

The following allows you to delete a record from your Web5 instance’s DWN:

```jsx
// Query for records
const response = await web5.dwn.records.query({
  message: {
    filter: {
      dataFormat: 'text/plain',
    },
  },
});

// For testing purposes grab the first indexed record from the response
const record = response.records[0];

// Delete the record
const deleteResult = await record.delete();
```
