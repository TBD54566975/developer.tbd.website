# Delete DWN Records

You can delete a record stored in the user's DWN, or another party's DWN (if permission has been granted).

The following snippets allow you to delete from a DWN:

### Delete record from the user's local DWN

<CodeSnippet functionName='deleteFromLocalDWN'/>


### Delete record from a remote DWN

<CodeSnippet functionName='deleteRecordFromDid'/>

The value for `from` is the target DID that you wish to delete the record from.
