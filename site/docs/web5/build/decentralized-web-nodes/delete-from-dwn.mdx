# Delete DWN Records

You can delete a record stored in the user's local DWN, remote DWN, or another party's DWN if permission has been granted.

The following snippet allows you to delete from a DWN:

### Delete recorm from the user's local DWN
```js
//Query records with plain text data format
const response = await web5.dwn.records.query({
  message: {
    filter: {
      dataFormat: 'text/plain',
    },
  },
});

// Grab the first indexed record
const record = response.records[0];

// Delete the record
const deleteResult = await record.delete();
```


### Delete record from a remote DWN

```js
const response = await web5.dwn.records.delete({
  from: 'did:example:alice',
  message: {
    recordId: 'bfw35evr6e54c4cqa4c589h4cq3v7w4nc534c9w7h5'
  }
});
```

The value for `from` is the target DID that we wish to delete the record from.
