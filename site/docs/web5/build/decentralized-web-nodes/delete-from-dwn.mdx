# Delete DWN Records

The following snippet allows you to delete from a DWN:

```js
//Query records with plain text data format
const response = await web5.dwn.records.query({
  message: {
    filter: {
      dataFormat: 'text/plain',
    },
  },
});

// Grab the first indexed record
const record = response.records[0];

// Delete the record
const deleteResult = await record.delete();
```
