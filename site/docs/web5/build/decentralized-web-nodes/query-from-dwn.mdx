# Query from DWN

You can use the `query` function to obtain records and protocols from a DWN. This guide shows how to do both, as well as how to sort the query results.

## Querying Protocols

The following snippet queries a DWN for protocols that match a given schema:

```js
const { protocols } = await web5.dwn.protocols.query({
  message: {
    filter: {
      protocol: "https://music.org/protocol",
    },
  },
});
```

## Querying Records

The following snippet queries a DWN for records that were written by a specific DID, match a given schema, and are in a specific data format:

```js
const { records } = await web5.dwn.records.query({
  from: 'did:example:alice',
  message: {
    filter: {
      schema: 'https://schema.org/Playlist',
      dataFormat: 'application/json'
    }
  }
});
```

## Sorting Query Results

Query results can be sorted via the `dateSort` field. Valid values for `dateSort` are:

| Value                     | Sorts Results By | Order       |
| -----------               | -----------      | ----------- |  
| **createdAscending**      | `dateCreated`    | ascending   |
| **createdDescending**     | `dateCreated`    | descending  |
| **publshedAscending**     | `datePublished`  | ascending   |
| **publishedDescending**   | `datePublished`  | descending  |

### Ascending Order

This code snippet queries for records with a plain text data format, and returns them in ascending order by the date they were [published](/docs/web5/build/decentralized-web-nodes/publishing-records):

```js
const response = await web5.dwn.records.query({
  message: {
    filter: {
      dataFormat: 'text/plain',
    },
    //highlight-start
    dateSort: 'publishedAscending'
    //highlight-end
  }
});
```

### Descending Order

This code snippet queries for protocols with a certain URL, and returns them in descending order by the date they were created.

```js
const { protocols } = await web5.dwn.protocols.query({
  message: {
    filter: {
      protocol: 'http://social-media.xyz',
    },
    //highlight-start
    dateSort: 'createdDescending'
    //highlight-end
  }
});
```
