# Read from Decentralized Web Nodes

Before reading from your Decentralized Web Node (DWN), be sure to check out our [Quickstart guide](../../quickstart) to ensure you’ve properly imported the Web5 SDK. Additionally, make sure you’ve set up a DID before attempting to read from a DWN.

## Read from a DWN

The following snippet allows you to read from your `Web5` instance’s DWN:

```jsx
// Query the record
const response = await web5.dwn.records.query({
  message: {
    filter: {
      dataFormat: 'text/plain',
    },
  },
});

// Read the record
response.records.forEach(async (record) => {
  const readResult = await record.data.text();
});
```
