# Read from DWN
You can get a specific record from a DWN, or an array of records.

## Get Record by recordId
If you know the `recordId` of the record you'd like to obtain, you can use the `read` function:

```js
// Get the record
const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.read({
  message: {
    recordId: 'bafyreiaz5oycqbrnmmpvffxqyoqxvx6bcnqueprmt2qnvzcurpc52r5uyy',
  }
});
```

## Get Records that Match Filter
However, you may not have the `recordId` avaialble, and instead need to query for records that match a specific filter. This will return an array of records:

```js
//Query records with plain text data format
const response = await web5.dwn.records.query({
  message: {
    filter: {
      dataFormat: 'text/plain',
    },
  },
});

// Loop through returned records and print text from each
response.records.forEach(async record => {
  console.log(await record.data.text());
});
```
