# Upgrade to DWA

## What is a DWA?

A [Decentralized Web App (DWA)](/blog/dwas-vs-pwas) is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that incorporates Web5 functionalities, providing offline capabilities and offline synchronization of [Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs)](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes/). 

This guide will walk you through upgrading your PWA to a DWA. For a practical implementation, refer to the [DWA starter app](https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwa-starter).

## Import packages

Import the following package to handle interactions with DWNs and manage offline data:

```js
import { activatePolyfills } from '@web5/api';
```

## Set up a service worker
[Service workers](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/service-workers) enable offline functionality and background processing.

The following snippet configures a service worker to activate polyfills, manage caching, and handle data synchronization tasks in the background:

```js
// Activate Web5 Service Worker Polyfills
activatePolyfills({
  onCacheCheck() {
    return {
      ttl: 30000,
    };
  },
});
```

## Fetch data via DRLs

Decentralized Resource Locators (DRLs) enable direct read access to permussioned data stored in DWNs. To read records from a DWN,  After writing records to a DWN, you can use DRLs (prefixed with `https://dweb`) to fetch the data. 

Here's how to fetch a record from a DWN using a DRL:

DRLs return JSON data that can be used throughout your web app, from populating UI elements to setting attributes on HTML tags.
