# Upgrade to DWA

## What is a DWA?

A [Decentralized Web App (DWA)](/blog/dwas-vs-pwas) is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that incorporates Web5 functionalities, providing offline capabilities and offline synchronization of [Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs)](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes/). 

This guide will walk you through upgrading your PWA to a DWA. For a practical implementation, refer to the [DWA starter app](https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwa-starter).

## Import packages

The following package import will manage the installation of a service worker for handling decentralized resources and enable the resolution of Decentralized Resource Locators (DRLs), which allow your app to fetch data from decentralized networks:

```js
import { activatePolyfills } from '@web5/api';
```

## Set up a service worker
Service workers enable offline functionality and background processing for PWAs. In this context, the service worker will act as a proxy between the traditional web and the decentralized web.
The following snippet configures a service worker to activate polyfills, manage caching, and handle data synchronization tasks in the background:

```js
// Activate Web5 Service Worker Polyfills
activatePolyfills({
  onCacheCheck() {
    return {
      ttl: 30000,
    };
  },
});
```

## Fetch data via DRLs

Decentralized Resource Locators (DRLs) enable direct access to data stored in Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs). After writing records to a DWN, you can use DRLs, prefixed with `dweb://`, to fetch this data. DRLs return JSON data that can be used throughout your web app, from populating UI elements to setting attributes on HTML tags.
