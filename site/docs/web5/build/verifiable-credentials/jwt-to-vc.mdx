# Parse JWT into VC

When [signing a Verifiable Credential (VC)](/docs/web5/build/verifiable-credentials/vc-issuance#sign-vc), a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) is returned.
This guide demonstrates how to parse the JWT to get the corresponding VC object.

## What is a JWT
A VC JWT is a secure URL-safe string representation of a credential, ideal for storage or transmission between two parties. 
JWT format is used to encode the credentials, making them both secure and easily transmissible.

**Example JWT**

<CodeSnippet functionName="assignVcJwt" />

## Decoding JWT

Once a VC JWT is received, the credential verifier will likely need to inspect or use the data that's contained within the credential.
They can use `parseJwt()` to decode the JWT and convert it back into a `VerifiableCredential` object. 
This object format is more convenient for accessing and manipulating the credential's data within their application.

<CodeSnippet functionName="parseSignedVcJwt" />

This returns the VC in JSON:

```js
{
  vcDataModel: {
    '@context': [ 'https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1' ],
    type: [ 'VerifiableCredential', 'EmploymentCredential' ],
    id: 'urn:uuid:8fd52030-1caf-4978-a35d-d417eb8e00b2',
    issuer: 'did:dht:kfdtbcm9zgocf5matf9fxtnnffhhzxc7mgbwr4k3x3qziaucpp4y',
    issuanceDate: '2023-12-21T17:02:01Z',
    credentialSubject: {
      id: 'did:dht:y39m48ozoete7z6fzaangcos87fhuh1dzi7f7jwbjft7otskh9to',
      position: 'Software Developer',
      startDate: '2021-04-01T12:34:56Z',
      employmentStatus: 'Contractor'
    },
    expirationDate: '2022-09-30T12:34:56Z'
  }
}
```
