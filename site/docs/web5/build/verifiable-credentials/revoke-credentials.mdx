# Revoking Verifiable Credentials
Verifiable credentials can be revoked. This can only be done by the issuer of the credential. Any verifier is then able to check the revocation status of a credential before accepting it as valid.

## Creating a revocable VC (Issuer)
For an issuer to be able to revoke a credential, they need to have a `StatusListCredential` - this is a type of Verifiable Credential that contains a list of revoked credentials - and is hosted online. The issuer can then issue a revocable credential by adding the `StatusListCredential` to the `credentialStatus` field of the customer's credential.

#### Create a `StatusListCredential`
<Shnip
  snippets={[
    { snippetName: 'createStatusListCredential', language: 'JavaScript'},
    { snippetName: 'createStatusListCredentialKt', language: 'Kotlin'}
    ]}
/>

#### Add `credentialStatus` to the revocable verifiable credential
<Shnip
  snippets={[
    { snippetName: 'createRevocableVerifiableCredential', language: 'JavaScript'},
    { snippetName: 'createRevocableVerifiableCredentialKt', language: 'Kotlin'},
    ]}
/>

The `statusListIndex` is a unique identifier for the revocable verifiable credential from the `StatusListCredential` that is generated by the issuer.

## Revoking a VC (Issuer)
To revoke a Verifiable Credential, the issuer can now add the `statusListIndex` of the credential to the `StatusListCredential` that was created earlier. This implies that the issuer creates a new `StatusListCredential` with an updated list of their revoked credentials. And they upload this updated `StatusListCredential` to the same URL as the previous one.

    { snippetName: 'revokeCredentialKt', language: 'Kotlin'},

## Determining if a VC has been revoked (Verifier)
To check the status of a verifiable credential, the verifier can do the following:
- Parse the presented verifiable credential to get the `credentialStatus` object.
- Fetch the `StatusListCredential` from the URI in the object to retrieve the credential.
- Pass the presented credential and the `StatusListCredential` to the `StatusListCredential.validateCredentialInStatusList()` method as shown below.
