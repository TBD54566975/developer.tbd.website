# Revoking Verifiable Credentials
it is possible to revoke the validity of a credential. This is done by the issuer of the credential. Any verifying party is then able to check the revocation status of a credential before accepting it as valid.

## Creating a revocable VC (Issuer)
For an issuer to be able to revoke a credential, they need to have a `StatusListCredential` - this is a type of Verifiable Credential that contains a list of revoked credentials - and is hosted online. The issuer can then issue a revocable credential by adding the `StatusListCredential` to the `credentialStatus` field of the customer's credential.

#### Add `credentialStatus` field to the VC referencing the created `StatusListCredential`

## Revoking a VC (Issuer)
To revoke a Verifiable Credential, the issuer can now add the `statusListIndex` of the credential to the `StatusListCredential` that was created earlier. This implies that the issuer creates a new `StatusListCredential` with an updated list of their revoked credentials. And they upload this updated `StatusListCredential` to the same URL as the previous one.

## Determining if a VC has been revoked (Verifier)
To check the status of a verifiable credential, the verifier can use the `StatusListCredential` to determine if the presented credential has been revoked. The verifier can do this by checking if the `statusListIndex` of the credential is present in the `StatusListCredential`.
