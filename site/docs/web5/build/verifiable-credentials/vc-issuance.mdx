# Issue a VC

This guide provides a step-by-step process for issuing a [verifiable credential (VC)](/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials), covering everything from installation to signing the credential.

<details>
<summary>Prerequisites</summary>

**Install Package**

```bash
npm i @web5/credentials
```

**Import Class**

```js
import { VerifiableCredential } from "@web5/credentials";
```

**Obtain DIDs**

VCs are issued to and from subjects of [Decentralized Identifiers (DID)](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers).
* If you don't already one, you can [create a DID](/docs/web5/build/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did#create-a-did-manually).
* Also, you'll need the DID of the entity you'll like to issue the VC to.

</details>

## VC Properties

Credentials are created in JSON form and contains the following properties:

* **type:** Type of the credential (e.g. EmploymentCredential, EducationCredential)
* **issuer:** DID of the entity who is issuing the credential
* **subject:** DID of the entity that the credential is being issued to
* **expirationDate:** (optional) The date when the credential expires (in ISO 8601 standard format)
* **data:** JSON containing claims that are being asserted


## Create VC

To create the VC, utilize the `VerifiableCredential.create()` method. Pass a JSON object containing the properties as shown below:

```js
const vc = await VerifiableCredential.create({
  type: 'EmploymentCredential',
  issuer: employerDid,
  subject: employeeDid,
  expirationDate: '2023-09-30T12:34:56Z',
  data: {
    "position": "Software Developer",
    "startDate": "2023-04-01T12:34:56Z",
    "employmentStatus": "Contractor"
  }
});
```

This results in:

```js
{
  "vcDataModel": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"
    ],
    "type": [
      "VerifiableCredential",
      "EmploymentCredential"
    ],
    "id": "urn:uuid:84953246-a77f-4c5a-a336-69a55bd92989",
    "issuer": "did:dht:fhzeks5bkferfztk6m63xjkg7a4hbf7snk444g8f1h1xapt391ty",
    "issuanceDate": "2023-03-31T06:08:49Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
      "id": "did:dht:usnoybts46xnei6brftkixe5qsbypxcye4th397bs4tyouqouyho",
      "position": "Software Developer",
      "startDate": "2023-04-01T12:34:56Z",
      "employmentStatus": "Contractor"
    },
    "expirationDate": "2023-09-30T12:34:56Z"
  }
}
```

## Sign VC

The next step is signing the VC. This cryptographic process, performed by the issuer, ensures the integrity and authenticity of the VC:

```js
const vc_jwt_employment = await vc.sign({ did: employerDid });
```

Signing the credential returns a VC JSON Web Token (JWT), which is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. 
JWT format is used to encode the credentials, making them both secure and easily transmissible.

Here's a truncated JWT for your reference:

```
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsI...
```

Giving this VC JWT to the holder completes the issuance of the credential.

VC JWTs can be converted back to a JSON object by applications that need to engage with the contents of the credential.
