# VCs in DWNs

In this guide, we'll cover how to write a [Verifiable Credential (VC)](/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials) to a [Decentralized Web Node (DWN)](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes), how to retrieve that stored VC by querying the DWN for it, and lastly how to parse the VC into a format that your application can work with.

## Storing VC in DWN

To store a VC in a DWN, you need to create a record with the VC data. The VC should already be [created](/docs/web5/build/verifiable-credentials/vc-issuance#create-vc) and in a [signed JWT format](/docs/web5/build/verifiable-credentials/vc-issuance#sign-vc). This is what that would look like:

```js
const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.create({
  data: signedVcJwt,
  message: {
    schema: 'EmploymentCredential',
    dataFormat: 'application/vc+jwt',
  },
});

// (optional) immediately send record to users remote DWNs
const { status } = await record.send(userDid);
```

`signedVcJwt` represents a signed VC JWT. The `schema` property should be the same as the VC type, and `dataFormat` specifies the format of the VC which is `application/vc+jwt`.

## Querying VC From DWN

To retrieve a stored VC from a DWN, you can use the `records.query()` method:

```js
const response = await web5.dwn.records.query({
  from: userDid,
  message: {
    filter: {
      schema: 'EmploymentCredential',
      dataFormat: 'application/vc+jwt',
    },
  },
});

const signedVcJwt = await response[0].data.text();
```

This will access the first record matching the filters you specified, `schema` and `dataFormat`. Keep in mind that this will access the VC as a JWT string.

## Parsing a VC JWT

After retrieving the signed JWT, you can convert the VC back into a readable JSON object with the `parseJwt()` method:

```js
const parsedVc = VerifiableCredential.parseJwt(signedVcJwt);
```

This returns:

```js
vcDataModel: {
  '@context': ['https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1'],
  type: ['VerifiableCredential', 'EmploymentCredential'],
  id: 'urn:uuid:12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcdef0',
  issuer: 'did:key:z6Mkn4w6nSaWe4fjNJRvaHZwFnMm5VexvjzDeozEu2G7jC34',
  issuanceDate: '2023-12-14T08:20:41Z',
  credentialSubject: {
    id: 'did:key:z6MkjGSeekPGE9QfczHWyW8v2ZzJU68kqSHzV7L2dmQyuyDu',
    employmentStatus: 'employed',
    company: 'TBD',
    position: 'Software Engineer'
  }
}
```
