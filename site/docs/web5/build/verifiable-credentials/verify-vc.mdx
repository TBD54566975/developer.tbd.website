# Verify VCs

When an entity receives the presentation of verifiable credentials (VCs), they must verify the integrity, authenticity, and content of the VCs.
The entity performing this verification is known as the **Verifier**.


## Verify

Upon receipt, the presentation of the VCs is encoded as [JWTs](/docs/web5/build/verifiable-credentials/jwt-to-vc#what-is-a-jwt) and can be verified via the `VerifiableCredentials.verify()` function. 

This function will:

✅ Parse and validate the structure of the JWT

✅ Ensure the presence of `alg` and `kid` in the JWT header

✅ Resolve the issuer's Decentralized Identifier (DID)

✅ Ensure the presence and validity of a verification method in the issuer's DID document

✅ Verify the integrity and authenticity of the issuer's signature using the public key associated with the verification method

If any of these steps fail, the function will throw an error with a message indicating the nature of the failure.

### Extracting VC JWTs from Presentation

A Presentation object includes multiple things including the presentation submission as well as the verifiable credential JWTs themselves.

        },

        "path": "$.verifiableCredential[1]"
      },
      {
        "id": "nameVerification",

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Since the VC JWTs are part of the larger Presentation JSON object, they must be extracted and verified individually.
Below is an example of how this might be implemented:

<CodeSnippet functionName="verifyCredentials" />

The code snippet above shows how to extract the VC JWTs from the Presentation and verify each one, aggregating the results.

The Verifier would then examine the results of the verifications to determine the errors:

<CodeSnippet functionName="checkVerificationResults" />


## Evaluate Presentation

After verifying the authenticity of the VCs, the next step is to ensure that they actually satisfy the requirements outlined in the presentation definition.
This can be done via the `PresentationExchange.evaluatePresentation()` function:

<CodeSnippet functionName="evaluatePresentation" />

<details>
<summary>Example Evaluation Results</summary>

```js
{
  "areRequiredCredentialsPresent": "info",
  "verifiableCredential": [
    "/* JWT VC for EmploymentCredential */",
    "/* JWT VC for PIICredential */",
  ],
  "warnings": [],
  "errors": [],
  "value": {
    "id": "WabEjZrPQQOQw8YUg9kIN",
    "definition_id": "presDefIdloanAppVerification123",
    "descriptor_map": [
      {
        "id": "employmentVerification",
        "format": "jwt_vc",
        "path": "$.verifiableCredential[0]"
      },
      {
        "id": "dobVerification",
        "format": "jwt_vc",
        "path": "$.verifiableCredential[1]"
      },
      {
        "id": "nameVerification",
        "format": "jwt_vc",
        "path": "$.verifiableCredential[1]"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

</details>

The `areRequiredCredentialsPresent` property of the evaluation results gives a status indication of whether the requirements were met:

* **info** - all required credentials are present
* **warn** - more credentials were presented than were required
* **error** - all required credentials are not present

If the status is `warn` or `error`, the details will be in the `warnings` or `error` array of the response.


## Additional Considerations

The `VerifiableCredential.verify()` function does not perform a revocation status check to determine whether the VCs have been revoked, nor does it verify that the VCs aren't expired.
We strongly reccommend that you verify this information before honoring the VCs as valid.

Once you're confident that the VCs are valid, you can proceed to [parse the JWTs into VC objects](/docs/web5/build/verifiable-credentials/jwt-to-vc) such that you may work with the credentials' data.
