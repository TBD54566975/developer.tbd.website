# Web5 CLI

The Web5 CLI is a command-line interface, built with Rust, allowing you to create and manage Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials directly from the command line.
This guide will walk you through installation and usage of the Web5 CLI.

## Installation

To install the Web5 CLI, run the following command:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TBD54566975/web5-rs/main/crates/web5_cli/install.sh | bash -s v0.0.4
```

## Creating a DID

The `web5 did create` subcommand allows you to create DIDs using different DID methods such as dht, jwk, and web. 

```bash
web5 did create <method> [options]
```

### Options
* `--no-indent`: Output the DID document without indentation.
* `--json-escape`: Escape JSON strings in the output.
* `--domain <domain>`: For did:web, specify the domain for the DID Web creation.
* `--no-publish`: For the dht method, prevents publishing the DID immediately.

### Examples

```bash
# Create a did:jwk with no indent and json escape
web5 did create jwk --no-indent --json-escape

# Create a did:web 
web5 did create web --domain example.com

# Create a did:dht without publishing
web5 did create dht --no-publish
```

## Resolving a DID

The `web5 did resolve` command allows you to resolve a DID.

```bash
web5 did resolve <did-uri> [options]
```

### Options
* `--no-indent`: Output the DID document without indentation.
* `--json-escape`: Escape JSON strings in the output.
