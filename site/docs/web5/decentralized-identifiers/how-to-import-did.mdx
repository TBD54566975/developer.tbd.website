# Import a DID

In this guide, you will learn how to take your [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/what-are-dids) with you to other apps, allowing you to keep your identity consistent everywhere across various platforms. 

## Export DID
You will start by exporting your DID. This method converts your [Bearer DID](/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did/#create-did) into a [Portable DID](/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did/#portable-did), a serialized and static representation suitable for storage or transfer. 

:::note
Your Portable DID contains private key material. Always store it securely, preferably in a trusted identity wallet or password manager.

## Import DID
You can import your Portable DID to an application using the `import` method. 

This converts your Portable DID back into a fully functional Bearer DID, allowing you to use it for various operations, including signing and verifying data.
