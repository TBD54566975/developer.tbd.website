# Update a DID

A [DID Document](/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/did_documents) provides a way to link a DID with the way the DID subject can be reached, i.e., through public keys, services endpoints, and more.
There are several reasons why one might need to update a DID document including adding/deleting/updating service endpoints and keys. 

In this guide, we'll demonstrate how to update a DID Document using the Web5 SDK.

:::info Prerequisites
To update a DID, you need access to your full [BearerDid](/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did#create-did).
:::

## Adding a Service

To add a new service, you can obtain the list of services from the DID Document, then add your new service to the list.

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    { snippetName: 'addServiceToDidDocJS', language: 'JavaScript' },
  ]}
/>

## Updating a Service

To update a service, you can find the service within the existing list of services, update any of the values, then republish the DID Document.

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    { snippetName: 'updateServiceEndpointJS', language: 'JavaScript' },
  ]}
/>

## Deleting a Service

To delete a service, you can remove the service from the existing list of services, then republish the DID Document.

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    { snippetName: 'removeServiceEndpointJS', language: 'JavaScript' },
  ]}
/>
