# Delete DWN Records

You can delete a record stored in the user's DWN, or another party's DWN (if permission has been granted).

The following snippets allow you to delete from a DWN:

### Delete record from the user's local DWN

<CodeSnippet snippetName='deleteRecordFromLocalDwn'/>


### Delete record from a remote DWN

<CodeSnippet snippetName='deleteRecordFromRemoteDwn'/>

### Delete parent record and all children

To delete a parent record along with all its child records, set the prune option to true.
