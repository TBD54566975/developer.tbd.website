When records are created, they are private by default. Private records are not accessible without the use of a [protocol](/docs/web5/decentralized-web-nodes/protocols/) or permissions. To make a record publicly available, the record must be published.

In this guide, weâ€™ll discuss how to publish a record.

## Publish a record upon creation

To publish a record, you must explicitly declare that record as published by setting the `published` attribute to `true` when creating it:

<CodeSnippet functionName='createPublishedRecord'/>

## Publishing records in the future

When specifying to publish a record without providing the `datePublished` attribute, the record will be published now (the same date it was created). However, it's also possible to publish a record in the future by providing a future date for the `datePublished` attribute:

<CodeSnippet functionName='createRecordWithDatePublished'/>

:::info
The `datePublished` value must be in ISO 8601 standard format for representing dates and times. It must be expressed in the **'YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.ssssssZ'** format, where YYYY is the 4-digit year, MM is the 2-digit month, DD is the 2-digit day, T is a separator, hh is the 2-digit hour in 24-hour format, mm is the 2-digit minute, ss.ssssss is the 2-digit second with microsecond precision of 6, and Z indicates the time is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
