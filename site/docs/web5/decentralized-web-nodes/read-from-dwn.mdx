# Read DWN Records
You can get a specific record from a DWN, or an array of records.

## Get Record by recordId
If you know the `recordId` of the record you'd like to obtain, you can use the `read` function:

<CodeSnippet snippetName='readRecordFromId'/>

## Get Records that Match Filter
However, you may not have the `recordId` available, and instead need to query for records that match a [specific filter](/docs/web5/decentralized-web-nodes/query-from-dwn#filterable-record-properties). This will return an array of records:

```js
//Query records with plain text data format
const response = await web5.dwn.records.query({
  message: {
    filter: {
      dataFormat: 'text/plain',
    },
  },
});

// Loop through returned records and print text from each
response.records.forEach(async record => {
  console.log(await record.data.text());
});
```
