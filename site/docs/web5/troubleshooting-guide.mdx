# Troubleshooting Guide

## UnhandledSchemeError: Reading from "node:crypto" is not handled by plugins (Unhandled scheme)

This is an issue with Webpack that happens mostly in Next.js projects. Here's how to solve it:

1. Run the following command to install three packages that will enable cryptographic functions and stream handling within the browser:

```bash
npm install crypto-browserify stream-browserify process
```

2. Then, in your `next.config.js` file, add the following:

```js
const webpack = require('webpack');

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,

  webpack: (config, { isServer, buildId, dev, webpack }) => {
    if (!isServer) {
      config.resolve.fallback = {
        ...config.resolve.fallback,
        stream: require.resolve('stream-browserify'),
        crypto: require.resolve('crypto-browserify'),
      };

      config.plugins.push(
        new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
          process: 'process/browser',
        }),
        new webpack.NormalModuleReplacementPlugin(/node:crypto/, (resource) => {
          resource.request = resource.request.replace(/^node:/, '');
        }),
      );
    }
    return config;
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

## ReferenceError: process is not defined

When starting up and connecting to the Web5 SDK, some polyfills might be missing. To fix this, update your Web5 import:

```js
import { Web5 } from '@web5/api';
```

## ProtocolAuthorizationIncorrectProtocolPath: Declared protocol path 'x' is not the same as actual protocol path 'y/x'

This could happen for a few reasons when working with protocols. Here are the debugging steps you could take:

- Confirm that the `protocolPath` in your `message` object is correct and matches the protocol path you declared in your protocol definition.
- Next check that you are not missing a `parentId` attribute when sending your request. This is a common mistake when creating a record in a protocol. For example, if you are creating a todo item in a todo list, you need to pass the `parentId` of the todo list to the todo item. Here's an example:

```js
await web5.dwn.records.create({
  data: todoData,
  message: {
    protocol: protocolDefinition.protocol,
    protocolPath: 'list/todo',
    schema: protocolDefinition.types.todo.schema,
    dataFormat: protocolDefinition.types.todo.dataFormats[0],
    parentId: listId.value,
  },
});
```

## Error: 'undefined' is not supported by the IPLD Data Model and cannot be encoded

This is a syntax error in the calling functon that causes the error. Check this function for any typos or missing attributes.

## Error: connect() failed due to unexpected state: ${storedIdentities} stored identities

This error happens when you try to connect to the Web5 SDK, but there are multiple stored identities in the application's data store, which causes a conflict during the connection process.

Since identities are stored in the browser memory, you can resolve this issue by **clearing your browser's cache**. Clearing the browser's cache will remove all stored identities and reset the application's state.
