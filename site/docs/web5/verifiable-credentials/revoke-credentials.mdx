# Revoking Verifiable Credentials

Revoking verifiable credentials (VCs) is a crucial aspect of maintaining their integrity and trustworthiness.
In this guide, we will explore the mechanisms and best practices for revoking verifiable credentials, ensuring they remain accurate and reliable over time.

## Create a Status List Credential

A **Status List Credential** is a specialized type of verifiable credential created by VC issuers to maintain a list of the statuses of other credentials, specifically focusing on those that have been revoked.
This list is hosted online to allow verifiers to quickly determine the validity of a credential.

### Example of Status List Credential

```js
{
  "vcDataModel": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
      "https://w3id.org/vc/status-list/2021/v1"
    ],
    "type": [
      "VerifiableCredential",
      "StatusList2021Credential"
    ],
    "id": "https://example.com/credentials/status/1",
    "issuer": "did:dht:9yiocuhw16grn1ityjcij3g4qrkwq65oh3x8qptbduybgaymbmoo",
    "issuanceDate": "2024-07-26T01:41:06Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
      "id": "https://example.com/credentials/status/1",
      "type": "StatusList2021",
      "statusPurpose": "revocation",
      "encodedList": "H4sIAAAAAAAAA-3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQwfoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIC3AYbSVKsAQAAA"
    }
  }
}
```

## Issue a Revocable Credential
Verifiable credentials are immutable, so an issuer cannot change the content of the VC after it is issued.
However, the issuer can include a `credentialStatus` property when issuing the credential.
This links the credential to its entry in the status list, allowing issuers to update its status at any time and verifiers to check the credential's status.

### Properties of credentialStatus

* **id**: URL that identifies the status information associated with the verifiable credential. It must not be the URL for the status list itself, but rather a unique identifier for the status entry within the status list​.

* **type**: The type of status entry, which must be `StatusList2021Entry`, indicating it follows the [Status List 2021 standard](https://www.w3.org/community/reports/credentials/CG-FINAL-vc-status-list-2021-20230102/).

* **statusPurpose**: The purpose of the status entry. Common values are `revocation` for permanently invalidating a credential and `suspension` for temporarily invalidating it.

* **statusListIndex**: An integer value (expressed as a string) identifying the bit position in the [status list's bitstring](https://www.w3.org/community/reports/credentials/CG-FINAL-vc-status-list-2021-20230102/#bitstring-generation-algorithm) that corresponds to the credential's status. A bit value of 0 means the credential is valid, while a bit value of 1 indicates it has been revoked. This efficient encoding allows for quick status checks by verifiers.

* **statusListCredential**: URL pointing to the Status List Credential, which contains the bitstring encoding the status of multiple credentials. This URL allows verifiers to retrieve and check the status list.

### Example of Revocable VC

```js
{
  "vcDataModel": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
      "https://w3id.org/vc/status-list/2021/v1"
    ],
    "type": [
      "VerifiableCredential",
      "StreetCred"
    ],
    "id": "urn:uuid:fddff3ca-cdee-403c-95d0-70608fc0b3d9",
    "issuer": "did:dht:9yiocuhw16grn1ityjcij3g4qrkwq65oh3x8qptbduybgaymbmoo",
    "issuanceDate": "2024-07-26T01:41:06Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
      "id": "did:dht:phaphcrybzdkxttu74nsuu9hyjxe19bzwymn8g18gac7ci1ifuoo",
      "streetCred": "high",
      "legit": true
    },
    "credentialStatus": {
      "id": "https://example.com/credentials/status/1#94567",
      "type": "StatusList2021Entry",
      "statusPurpose": "revocation",
      "statusListIndex": "94567",
      "statusListCredential": "https://example.com/credentials/status/1"
    }
  }
}
```

## Revoking a VC
To revoke a Verifiable Credential, the issuer must add the credential to a `StatusListCredential`.
To do this, the issuer must create a new `StatusListCredential` with an updated list of their revoked credentials, then upload this updated `StatusListCredential` to the same URL as the previous one.

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    { snippetName: 'revokeCredentialJs', language: 'JavaScript'},
    { snippetName: 'revokeCredentialKt', language: 'Kotlin'},
    ]}
/>

Note the `encodedList` holds the compressed bitstring.

### Example of Updated Status List Credential

```js
{
  "vcDataModel": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
      "https://w3id.org/vc/status-list/2021/v1"
    ],
    "type": [
      "VerifiableCredential",
      "StatusList2021Credential"
    ],
    "id": "https://example.com/credentials/status/1",
    "issuer": "did:dht:9yiocuhw16grn1ityjcij3g4qrkwq65oh3x8qptbduybgaymbmoo",
    "issuanceDate": "2024-07-26T01:41:06Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
      "id": "https://example.com/credentials/status/1",
      "type": "StatusList2021",
      "statusPurpose": "revocation",
      "encodedList": "H4sIAAAAAAAAA-3OMQ0AAAgDsOHfNBp2kZBWQRMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL6Z6wAAAAAAtQVQdb5gAEAAAA"
    }
  }
}
```

## Check VC Status

To check the status of a verifiable credential, the verifier can do the following:
1. Parse the presented verifiable credential to get the `credentialStatus` object.
2. Fetch the `StatusListCredential` from the URI in the object to retrieve the credential.
3. Pass the presented credential and the `StatusListCredential` to the `validateCredentialInStatusList()` method as shown below. It will return `true` if revoked.
