# Issue a VC

This guide provides a step-by-step process for issuing a [verifiable credential (VC)](/docs/web5/verifiable-credentials/what-are-vcs), covering everything from installing the SDK to signing the credential.

<details>
<summary>Prerequisites</summary>

**Install Packages**

<Dependencies languageDependencies={[
  { language: 'javascript', dependencies: ['@web5/credentials'] },
  { language: 'maven', dependencies: ['web5-credentials'] },
  { language: 'gradle', dependencies: ['web5-credentials'] },
]}/> 

**Install Classes**

<Shnip
  inlineSnippets={[
    {
      code: `import { VerifiableCredential } from "@web5/credentials";`,
      language: 'JavaScript',
    },
    {
      code: `import xyz.block.web5.credentials.VerifiableCredential`,
      language: 'Kotlin',
    }
  ]}
/>

**Obtain DIDs**

VCs are issued to and from subjects of [Decentralized Identifiers (DID)](/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/what-are-dids).

- If you don't already have one, you can [create a DID](/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did).
- Also, you'll need the DID of the entity you'll like to issue the VC to.

</details>

## VC Properties

Credentials are created in JSON format and contain the following properties:

- **type:** Type of the credential (e.g. EmploymentCredential, EducationCredential)
- **issuer:** DID of the entity who is issuing the credential
- **subject:** DID of the entity that the credential is being issued to
- **expirationDate:** (optional) The date when the credential expires (in ISO 8601 standard format)
- **data:** JSON containing claims that are being asserted

## Create VC

To create the VC, utilize the `VerifiableCredential.create()` method. Pass a JSON object containing the properties as shown below:

<Shnip
   snippets={[
    { snippetName: 'createEmploymentCredential', language: 'JavaScript'},
    { snippetName: 'createEmploymentCredentialKt', language: 'Kotlin'}
    ]}
/>

This results in:

<Shnip
  inlineSnippets={[
    {
      code: `
{
  "vcDataModel": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"
    ],

      "EmploymentCredential"
    ],
    "id": "urn:uuid:84953246-a77f-4c5a-a336-69a55bd92989",
    "issuer": "did:dht:fhzeks5bkferfztk6m63xjkg7a4hbf7snk444g8f1h1xapt391ty",

      "employmentStatus": "Contractor"
    },
    "expirationDate": "2023-09-30T12:34:56Z"
  }
}
      `,
      language: 'JavaScript',
    },
    {
      code:`
{
  "@context": [

  ],
  "type": [
    "VerifiableCredential",
    "EmploymentCredential"

    "employmentStatus": "Contractor"
  }
}
      `,
      language: 'Kotlin', 
      codeLanguage: 'JavaScript'
    }
  ]}
/>

## Sign VC

The next step is signing the VC. This cryptographic process, performed by the issuer, ensures the integrity and authenticity of the VC:

<Shnip
   snippets={[
    { snippetName: 'signEmploymentCredential', language: 'JavaScript'},
    { snippetName: 'signEmploymentCredentialKt', language: 'Kotlin'}
    ]}
/>

Signing the credential returns a [VC JWT](/docs/web5/verifiable-credentials/jwt-to-vc#what-is-a-jwt):

```
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsI...
```

Giving this VC JWT to the holder completes the issuance of the credential.

VC JWTs can be [converted back](/docs/web5/verifiable-credentials/jwt-to-vc#decoding-jwt) to a JSON object by applications that need to engage with the contents of the credential.
