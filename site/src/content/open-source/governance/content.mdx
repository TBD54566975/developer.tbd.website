<h2>Contributors</h2>
<p className="text-primary-yellow text-[18px] mb-6">
  Anyone may be a contributor to TBD projects. Contribution may take the form of:
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Asking and answering questions on Discord or GitHub Issues</li>
      <li>Filing an issue</li>
      <li>Offering a feature or bug fix via a Pull Request</li>
      <li>Suggesting documentation improvements</li>
      <li>...and more!</li>
      <li>Anyone with a GitHub account may use the project issue trackers and communications channels. We welcome newcomers, so don't hesitate to say hi!</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</p>

<h2>Maintainers</h2>
<p className="text-primary-yellow text-[18px] mb-6">
  Maintainers have write access to GitHub repositories and act as project administrators. They approve and merge pull requests, cut releases, and guide collaboration with the community. They have:
  <ul>
    <li>Commit access to their project's repositories</li>
    <li>Write access to continuous integration (CI) jobs</li>
    <li>Both maintainers and non-maintainers may propose changes to source code. The mechanism to propose such a change is a GitHub pull request. Maintainers review and merge (land) pull requests.</li>
  </ul>
  If a maintainer opposes a proposed change, then the change cannot land. The exception is if the Governance Committee (GC) votes to approve the change despite the opposition. Usually, involving the GC is unnecessary.

  <h3 className="mt-6">Maintainer activities</h3>
