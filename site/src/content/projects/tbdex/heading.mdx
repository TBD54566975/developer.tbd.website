# TBDEX: A LIQUIDITY PROTOCOL

## An open financial protocol that can move value anywhere around the world in a more efficient and cost-effective way than what’s possible in traditional financial systems.

The web connected us all. But money and payments have not kept pace.

The legacy payments system is held together with proverbial duct tape that masks fundamental problems: final settlement of payments is slow, expensive, and never quite final. Risks get priced in as expensive account fees – or exclusion from the system itself. This hits the most economically disadvantaged the hardest.

A <TooltipWrapper trigger="decentralized">a network that is not controlled by a central entity</TooltipWrapper> and <TooltipWrapper trigger="trustless">trust is established in a decentralized way, for example via decentralized identity and verifiable credentials</TooltipWrapper> system shifts the paradigm to financial access. There are no credit checks or monthly account fees. Open, decentralized, and <TooltipWrapper trigger="permissionless">the ability to participate in a network without the need for application or approval</TooltipWrapper> networks let you send money anywhere in the world, near instantly.

tbDEX is a decentralized, permissionless protocol. It opens the door to <TooltipWrapper trigger="Self-Sovereign Identity">an approach that gives individuals ownership and control of their digital identities</TooltipWrapper> and access to the financial system for all. And because it abstracts away the complexity of decentralization, developers can focus on building great things.
