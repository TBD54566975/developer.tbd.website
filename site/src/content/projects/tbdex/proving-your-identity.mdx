Alice holds a digital wallet that securely manages all aspects of her identity, 
including her <TooltipWrapper trigger="identifiers">Unique address to personal 
information that may be required for currency exchange with a regulated financial 
institution</TooltipWrapper>, credentials, and <TooltipWrapper trigger="authorizations">
permissions granted for another person or app to view or exchange data with you</TooltipWrapper> 
for external apps and entities. Alice uses her wallet to request USD in exchange for 
100 units of digital currency. 

Because Alice is <TooltipWrapper trigger="off-ramping">Converting digital money to 
legacy money, fiat.</TooltipWrapper> from digital currency to fiat, most Participating Financial 
Institutions(PFIs) are required to verify Alice’s identity in order to fulfill 
their regulatory and compliance obligations. PFIs that are interested in fulfilling 
Alice’s request reply with a bid as well as their identity verification requirements 
for fulfillment. 

Alice chooses a bid which will need Know Your Customer (KYC) 
information (such as name, address, date of birth). Alice has already provided all 
of the necessary information to another PFI in the past. So, Alice allows her wallet 
to provide a <TooltipWrapper trigger="verifiable credential">digital certificates 
that make it easy to share information online in a private and secure way</TooltipWrapper> issued from the past PFI to the bidding PFI, along with the currency
to exchange. The PFI verifies the credential and continues with fulfillment.
