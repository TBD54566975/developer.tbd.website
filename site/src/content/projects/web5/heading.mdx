# WEB5: A DECENTRALIZED WEB PLATFORM

## Putting you in control of your data and identity

The web democratized the exchange of information, but it's missing a key layer: identity. We struggle to secure personal data with hundreds of accounts and passwords we can’t remember. On the web today, identity and personal data have become the property of third parties.

Web5 brings <TooltipWrapper trigger="decentralized identity">identity created, owned, and controlled by individuals, without reliance on centralized entities</TooltipWrapper> and data storage to your applications. It lets devs focus on creating delightful user experiences, while returning ownership of data and identity to individuals.
