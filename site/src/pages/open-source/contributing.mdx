## Contributing Code Snippets

Our Code Snippet system allows for updates in one place while ensuring code is runnable and tested, enhancing our tutorials and guides.

### Steps to Create a Code Snippet

1. **Create Your Test**: Navigate to `site/__test__` and create a test file named to match the functionality of the code, e.g., `how-to-create-did.test.js`.

   :::note
   Use the `.test.` naming convention for Vite to recognize and run these tests.
   :::

2. **Tag Your Snippets**: In your test files, use `:snippet-start:` and `:snippet-end:` tags to mark the beginning and end of a code snippet. Immediately name your snippet after the `:snippet-start:` tag.

   ```js
   test('createDidDht creates a DID with did:dht method', async () => {
     // :snippet-start: createDidDht
     const didDht = await DidDhtMethod.create({ publish: true });
     // ... rest of the code ...
     // :snippet-end:
   });
   ```

3. After creating your snippets, run the command `pnpm run shnip`. This will generate a folder called `snippets` and create a directory structure similar to where the file is.

4. In the generated folder you'll find the generated file named as `functionName.snippet.js` (or the respective file extension). For example, the above snippet will be `createDidDht.snippet.js`.

To use the snippet in your documentation(`.mdx` file), you're going to use the `Shnip` component. The Shnip component will dynamically import your snippets for you. Here's an example on how to use it:

// if it's a multi language doc, you'll need to specify it with the LanguageSwitcher component

<LanguageSwitcher languages="JavaScript, Kotlin" />

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    { snippetName: 'createDidKey', language: 'JavaScript' },
    { snippetName: 'kt_createDidKey', language: 'Kotlin' },
  ]}
/>
```

This is how you can add a generated code snippet and an inline hardcoded snippet into the doc:

```js
<Shnip
  snippets={[{ name: 'assignVcJwt', language: 'JavaScript' }]}
  inlineSnippets={[
    {
      code: `
            val signedVcJwt = "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImtp..."
      `,
      language: 'Kotlin',
    },
  ]}
/>
```

To display inline code in a language different from the tab's primary language, use `codeLanguage`.
If `codeLanguage` is unspecified, it defaults to `language`.
Example: For Bash in a JavaScript tab, set `language: 'JavaScript`', `codeLanguage: 'bash'`

```js
<Shnip
  inlineSnippets={[
    {
      code: `
npm install @web5/credentials
npm install @web5/dids
      `,
      language: 'JavaScript', // The tab's context.
      codeLanguage: 'bash', // Snippet's actual language
    },
  ]}
/>
```

MDX and JSX struggle to parse line breaks.
For controlled line breaks in inline snippets, use `breakLineAt` with line numbers in an array.
Example: To break after lines 1 and 5, set breakLineAt: [1, 5]

```js
<Shnip
  inlineSnippets={[
    {
      code: `
import { VerifiableCredential, PresentationExchange } from "@web5/credentials";
class SwiftiesFanClub {
  constructor(level, legit) {
    // indicates the fan's dedication level
    this.level = level; 
    // indicates if the fan is a genuine Swiftie
    this.legit = legit; 
  }
}
      `,
      breakLineAt: [1, 5],
    },
  ]}
/>
```

To add titles to code snippets, use the title prop. Example: title: 'Issuer.js' adds a title to the snippet.

```
<Shnip
 snippets={[{ name: 'assignVcJwt', language: 'JavaScript', title: 'Issuer.js' }]}
  inlineSnippets={[
    {
      code: `
import { VerifiableCredential, PresentationExchange } from "@web5/credentials";
class SwiftiesFanClub {
  constructor(level, legit) {
    // indicates the fan's dedication level
    this.level = level;
    // indicates if the fan is a genuine Swiftie
    this.legit = legit;
  }
}
      `,
     title: 'Issuer.js',
    }
  ]}
/>
```

## Using Prepend tags

To enhance our documentation with executable code snippets that remain synchronized with the latest test cases, we've introduced prepend tags. These tags allow you to specify setup code, such as import statements, that should be automatically included at the beginning of designated snippets. This ensures that our documentation reflects accurate and executable code examples.

## Directory Structure Configurations

- match: Mimics the test file's directory structure.
- byLanguage: Organizes snippets into language-specific directories.
- organized: A structure that organizes by language and function name. For example: `/snippets/js/createDidDht` and `/snippets/kt/createDidDht`
- flat: Places all snippets directly within the snippets folder.

### Usage

Prepend tags are used to mark blocks of code that should be prepended to one or more snippets. Here's how to use them:

1. Marking Prepend Blocks: In your test files, use the :prepend-start: and :prepend-end: tags to denote the beginning and end of a code block that should be prepended. Immediately after the :prepend-start: tag, specify the names of the snippets that should include this block, separated by spaces.

```js
// :prepend-start: snippetName1 snippetName2
import { SomeLibrary } from 'some-library';
// Additional setup code...
// :prepend-end:
```

2. Associating with Snippets: Ensure that the snippet names provided after the :prepend-start: tag match exactly with the names used in your :snippet-start: tags. This association is case-sensitive and must be precise to ensure the correct prepend blocks are included.

### Generating Snippets with Prepend Blocks

After marking your prepend blocks and associating them with snippets, run the pnpm shnip command. This process will automatically prepend the specified blocks to the snippets and generate the output in the configured snippets directory.

## Example

```js
// :prepend-start: createDidDht
import { DidDhtMethod } from '@web5/dids';
// :prepend-end:

// :snippet-start: createDidDht
const didDht = await DidDhtMethod.create({ publish: true });
// :snippet-end:
```

The generated snippet will include the import statement at the top, ensuring the snippet is executable and reflects the necessary setup:

```js
import { DidDhtMethod } from '@web5/dids';

const didDht = await DidDhtMethod.create({ publish: true });
```

## CLI

- Clear Command: `pnpm shnip clear`
- Structure Flag: `pnpm shnip --structure byLanguage`

### Caveats for Code Snippets

- The code snippet function names need to be unique, these names are what is used to generate/name the snippet files.
- These tests are only testing the code snippets. There are more thorough tests that actually test the SDK.

### Running tests

You can use the following scripts to run the tests:

- `pnpm test` to run tests
- `pnpm test:watch` to run tests in dev mode
