## Contributing Code Snippets
If you're working on tutorials or guides of any sort, we have a Code Snippet system that allows us to update the code in one place but also allows it to be runnable and tested.

Here are some steps on how you'd make a Code Snippet:

We have to make updates in 3 places per Code Snippet.

1. The code snippet itself will go in the `code-snippets` directory. We make code snippets based on the page.

So if you're making a code snippet for the `api/web5-js/protocols.md` page, you'd make a file at `api/web5-js/protocols.js` and put the code snippet in there.
If you wanted to make a code snippet specifically for the web5-js index page, you'd name it `index.js`. So the path to the code snippet would be `code-snippets/api/web5-js/index.js`.

** Note: **
Your code snippet should be within a function block. The function block is how we name the code snippet. We only display what's in the body of the function block, minus the return statement.

For example:

```js
function codeSnippetFunctionName() {
  // Your code snippet goes here

  const result = Web5.connect();
  
  return result;
}
```

It's important to make your function name as specific as possible, because it will be used to reference the code snippet in the code-snippets.json file. Duplicate names will overwrite one another.

(We should probably come up with an agreed upon naming convention)


Under the hood, a script will run called `extract-code-snippets` which will add your code snippet to the `code-snippets.json` file. This file is used to reference your code snippet within the `<CodeSnippet />` component.

2. The second update you'll make would be on the content page itself. Add the following snippet where you'd like the code snippet to exist:

```jsx
<CodeSnippet functionName="codeSnippetFunctionName" />
```

The CodeSnippet component will look for the function name you provided in the `code-snippets.json` file and render the code snippet. If the name doesn't exist it will display an error instead.

3. Write tests for the code snippet.

Below is a template we can use that will be necessary for nearly every test we write for Web5.

```js
import { test, beforeAll, expect, describe } from 'vitest';
import { Web5 } from '@web5/api/browser';
// import your functions from your codesnippet file here

let web5;
let record;
let myDid;

beforeAll(async () => {
  const result = await Web5.connect();
  web5 = result.web5;
  myDid = result.did;
});

// example of what real tests look like for the protocols.js file
describe('tests for /api/web5-js/dwn/protocols.js', () => {
  test('queryMusicProtocol', async () => {
    //this calls the function that returns the code snippet
    const { protocols, status } = await queryMusicProtocol(web5);
    // expect.soft() will note any failures if they occur but will continue running the test
    expect.soft(protocols).toBeDefined();
    expect(status.code).toBe(200);
  });

  test('configureProtocolWithDefinition', async () => {
    const { protocol, status } = await configureProtocolWithDefinition(
      web5,
      myDid,
      protocolDefinition,
    );
    // We do 202 for this test because protocols comes back undefined, need to check if this is expected behavior.
    expect(status.code).toBe(202);
  });

  test('queryProtocolDescending', async () => {
    const { protocols, status } = await queryProtocolDescending(web5);
    expect.soft(protocols).toBeDefined();
    expect(status.code).toBe(200);
  });
});
```

### Caveats for Code Snippets

- It's crucial that the `return` lines are a single line only. It only hides the return line, but it's still there for testing purposes.
- Tests won't be high quality depending on what gets returned. In some examples we only return a DID, but not the status code so we'll have to make tests around those types of instances.
