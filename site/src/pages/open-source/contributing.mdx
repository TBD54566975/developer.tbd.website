## Contributing Code Snippets

If you're working on tutorials or guides of any sort, we have a Code Snippet system that allows us to update the code in one place but also allows it to be runnable and tested.

Here are some steps on how you'd make a Code Snippet:

We have to make updates in 3 places per Code Snippet.

1. The code snippet itself will go in the `code-snippets` directory. We make code snippets based on the page.

So if you're making a code snippet for the `api/web5-js/protocols.md` page, you'd make a file at `api/web5-js/protocols.js` and put the code snippet in there.
If you wanted to make a code snippet specifically for the web5-js index page, you'd name it `index.js`. So the path to the code snippet would be `code-snippets/api/web5-js/index.js`.

** Note: **
Your code snippet should be within a function block. The function block is how we name the code snippet. We only display what's in the body of the function block, minus the return statement.

For example:

```js
function codeSnippetFunctionName() {
  // Your code snippet goes here

  const result = Web5.connect();

  return result;
}
```

It's important to make your function name as specific as possible, because it will be used to reference the code snippet in the code-snippets.json file. Duplicate names will overwrite one another.

(We should probably come up with an agreed upon naming convention)

Under the hood, a script will run called `extract-code-snippets` which will add your code snippet to the `code-snippets.json` file. This file is used to reference your code snippet within the `<CodeSnippet />` component.

2. The second update you'll make would be on the content page itself. Add the following snippet where you'd like the code snippet to exist:

```jsx
<CodeSnippet functionName="codeSnippetFunctionName" />
```

The CodeSnippet component will look for the function name you provided in the `code-snippets.json` file and render the code snippet. If the name doesn't exist it will display an error instead.

3. Write tests for the code snippet.

Below is an example test file.

The file path should match the same path as both code snippet and the actual content:

`__tests__/code-snippets/api/web5-js/protocols.test.js` would be the path for the protocols example above.

```js
import { test, beforeAll, expect, describe } from 'vitest';
import { Web5 } from '@web5/api';
// import your functions from your codesnippet file
import {
  queryMusicProtocol,
  queryProtocolDescending,
  configureProtocolWithDefinition,
} from '../../../code-snippets/api/web5-js/protocols';

let web5;
let record;
let myDid;

beforeAll(async () => {
  const result = await Web5.connect();
  web5 = result.web5;
  myDid = result.did;
});

// example of what real tests look like for the protocols.js file
describe('tests for /api/web5-js/dwn/protocols.js', () => {
  test('queryMusicProtocol', async () => {
    //this calls the function that returns the code snippet
    const { protocols, status } = await queryMusicProtocol(web5);
    // expect.soft() will note any failures if they occur but will continue running the test
    expect.soft(protocols).toBeDefined();
    expect(status.code).toBe(200);
  });

  test('configureProtocolWithDefinition', async () => {
    const { protocol, status } = await configureProtocolWithDefinition(
      web5,
      myDid,
      protocolDefinition,
    );
    expect(status.code).toBe(202);
  });

  test('queryProtocolDescending', async () => {
    const { protocols, status } = await queryProtocolDescending(web5);
    expect.soft(protocols).toBeDefined();
    expect(status.code).toBe(200);
  });
});
```

### Caveats for Code Snippets

- It's crucial that the `return` lines are a single line only. It only hides the return line, but it's still there for testing purposes.
- These tests are only testing the code snippets. There are more thorough tests that actually test the SDK.
