## TBD Open Source Security Policy

Security is a core principle built into the TBD ecosystem. In open finance, we are in the business of trust.

A secure environment not only protects our assets but also strengthens the 
relationships we have built throughout our community.

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover or suspect any security vulnerabilities within our open source projects, 
we encourage you to promptly report them to us via email at security@tbd.email. 
Your diligence in bringing such issues to our attention is invaluable in maintaining 
the integrity and security of our software.

### Confidentiality and Collaboration

Please do not open issues for security vulnerabilities in the project's public issue tracker or share in 
other public channels.

Our security response team consists of engineering leaders, security experts, TBD management, and 
the Head of Open Source. We will work with you to confirm the vulnerabilitity, remediate, and responsibily 
communicate recommended actions to the public.

### Valid Security Reports

A valid security report should include:

* Description of the vulnerability
* Steps to reproduce or exploit
* Potential impact

The more context you can provide, the better. This will help us reproduce your use case and 
potentially validate the vulnerability.

We appreciate you - and your efforts in protecting open finance and the global TBD Community.
