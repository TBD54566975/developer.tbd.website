# Meet TBD at WeAreDevelopers World Congress!

TBD is building platforms and protocols that enable developers to easily build decentralized applications. TBDâ€™s vision is a decentralized future that returns

solve real problems for real people. To learn more about Web5 checkout our [Docs](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/).
