# Meet TBD at WeAreDevelopers!

As one of four businesses at Block (fka Square), TBD is focused on creating **open** and **decentralized** technologies to connect the financial world. 
Guided by this vision, TBD is building an **open source developer platform** and infrastructure that enables **everyone** to access and participate in the global economy. 
We invite you to join us in creating and adopting open and decentralized technologies that solve real problems for real people.
To learn more about our projects check out our [Docs](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/).
