# Using Identity Agents

Identity Agents are a specialized type of [agent](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-web-nodes/agents/) that act as personal identity managers.  Similar to how a password manager securely stores login credentials for different web apps, Identity Agents manage your [DIDs](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/what-are-dids).

By default, the `Web5.connect()` function generates a **new** identity; however, Identity Agents allow you to connect to a Web5 app with an **existing** identity. This is useful for maintaining a cohesive online presence.

This guide will walk you through creating an Identity Agent as a standalone application to manage multiple user identities and connect to a **separate** Web5 application.


<details>
<summary>Prerequisites</summary>

**Install the following packages**

```bash
npm i @web5/dids @web5/identity-agent @web5/api
```

**Import the following modules**

```js
import { DidIonMethod } from '@web5/dids';
import { IdentityAgent } from '@web5/identity-agent';
import { Web5, getTechPreviewDwnEndpoints } from '@web5/api';
```

</details>

## Initialize the Agent
To create an Identity Agent, start by creating an instance of the `IdentityAgent`.

<CodeSnippet functionName="createIdentityAgent" />

## Prompt Users to Authenticate
In your Identity Agent app, include the code snippet below to prompt users to authenticate with a one-time passphrase for security purposes.

<CodeSnippet functionName="authenticateIdentityAgent" />

## Connect DIDs to DWNs
To add [DWNs](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-web-nodes/what-are-dwns/) as service endpoints to the DIDs that will be managed by the Identity Agent, you can add the endpoints as `didOptions`.

Below is an example using TBD-hosted DWN endpoints:

<CodeSnippet functionName="getDwnEndpoints" />


<details>
<summary>Expected Output of didOptions</summary>

```js
{
  keySet: { verificationMethodKeys: [ [Object], [Object] ] },
  services: [
    {
      id: '#dwn',
      serviceEndpoint: [Object],
      type: 'DecentralizedWebNode'
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

## Create Identities
Now that `didOptions` contains cryptographic key pairs and service endpoints, you can create as many identities as necessary.

Each identity, linked to a unique DID, represents and compartmentalizes different aspects of a user. For example, a user can have an identity for social media interactions and another for professional engagements.

<CodeSnippet functionName="createSocialMediaAndCareerIdentity" />

:::note
* The `name` field serves as a friendly name for reference.
* The `kms` field stands for [Key Management Service](/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/key-management) and can securely store and manage the cryptographic keys associated with a DID. If you don't specify a particular key management service, such as AWS Key Management Service, Web5 will default to an in-memory key manager.

## Use your Identity in a Web5 Application
Once your Identity Agent is set up to manage multiple identities, you can use it to help you login to a Web5 application. Here's the typical workflow:

1. The Web5 application may display a QR code or a deep link for login purposes.
2. Use the Identity Agent to scan the QR code or click the deep link to establish a connection between your Identity Agent and the Web5 application.
3. The Identity Agent then prompts you to select the identity you prefer to use for authentication.

## Connect to Web5
Finally, the Web5 application can use the DID linked to your identity, so that you can interact within the Web5 application as your chosen identity.

<CodeSnippet functionName="connectIdentityToWeb5" />
