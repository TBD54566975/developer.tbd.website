  As stewards of an open source ecosystem, we champion innovation from the community. To
  encourage new ideas from folks around the world, TBD offers The
  Open Source Incubation Program.

  TBD Incubation projects are managed by community contributors. They advance the
  decentralized web and accelerate development and adoption of the Web5 platform.
  Like all projects in the TBD ecosystem, they follow our <a href="/open-source/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>
  and <a href="/open-source/governance">Governance</a>
  model, fostering an inclusive community. Incubation projects benefit from
  TBD’s open source programs including GitHub and our Discord server.

  When projects reach maturity, they may apply to be promoted out of Incubation into a central project.
