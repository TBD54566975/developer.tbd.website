Bob holds a digital wallet and has granted it access to his transaction history, credentials, and other relevant preferences that are in his <TooltipWrapper trigger="personal data store">(DWN) decentralized web node</TooltipWrapper>. Bob likes his wallet but is tempted to switch to a different one that has a feature
his current wallet lacks. Bob downloads the new wallet and grants it permission to
access his transactions, digital currency balances, and dark mode preference from his
data store. Bob uses both wallets for a week and the data seamlessly syncs across
the wallets. Bob decides that he prefers his old wallet over the new one. He revokes
all permissions granted to the new wallet and uninstalls it.
