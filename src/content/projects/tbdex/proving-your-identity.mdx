Alice holds a digital wallet that securely manages all aspects of her identity, including her

<TooltipWrapper trigger="identifiers">
  Unique address to personal information that may be required for currency
  exchange with a regulated financial institution
</TooltipWrapper>
, credentials, and <TooltipWrapper trigger="authorizations">
  permissions granted for another person or app to view or exchange data with
  you
</TooltipWrapper> for external apps and entities. Alice uses her wallet to request
USD in exchange for 100 units of digital currency. Because Alice is <TooltipWrapper trigger="off-ramping">
  Converting digital money to legacy money, fiat.
</TooltipWrapper> from digital currency to fiat, most Participating Financial Institutions
(PFIs) are required to verify Alice’s identity in order to fulfill their regulatory
and compliance obligations. PFIs that are interested in fulfilling Alice’s request
reply with a bid as well as their identity verification requirements for fulfillment.
Alice chooses a bid which will need Know Your Customer (KYC) information (such as
name, address, date of birth). Alice has already provided all of the necessary information
to another PFI in the past. So Alice allows her wallet to provide a <TooltipWrapper trigger="verifiable credential">
  digital certificates that make it easy to share information online in a
  private and secure way
</TooltipWrapper> issued from the past PFI to the bidding PFI, along with the currency
to exchange. The PFI verifies the credential and continues with fulfillment.
